## 17.1 - Introduction
* side bar: **etiological** - (in medicine) causing or contributing to the development/growth of a disease or condition
* *complexity* and *collaboration* define how healthcare in the 21st century
  * complexity arises from a deeper understanding of health and disease
  * collaboration is more than just between clinician to clinician
    * also about how the patient, family, community, population and society contribute to health/well-being
* Four common HC challenges that consumer informatics specifically address:
  * consumer engagement, information sharing, communication and decision facilitation
### 17.1.1 - The Challenge of Improving Consumer Engagement
* forms of patient participation: shared decision-making, self-care and collaborative practices
* **Distributed-managed care models** - consumers are their own case workers and they have agency to pick and choose their providers
* Central tenet is that not even though not all patients will participate, those that do will lead to higher quality care than patients than don't
  * Extrinsic motivators (lol Rally, money, goods, praise) can help woo patients that aren't naturally inclined to be involved in their own care
### 17.1.2 - The Challenge of Improving the Information Available to Consumers
* Old and suboptimal ways to educate/convey new findings to the public: pamphlets, (newspaper) articles, phone calls
* KPIs to look for when picking a modality: health literacy, widespread access, appropriately timed/placed, reaching all possible audiences
### 17.1.3 - The Challenge of Improving the Communication Among Consumers and Providers
* Consumer-provider interactions
  * CHI (Consumer Health Informatics) primes patients to be able to have educated/productive discussions with their providers
* Consumer-to-consumer communication has always been difficult
  * social media (Vytality Health)
  * historically: support groups for diseases run by churches, community centers, or health institutes
### 17.1.4 - The Challenge of Improving Consumer Decision-Making
* Collecting data isn't the most important part of this process
* The importance is consumers making educated, high-quality and *actionable* decisions and act on them
* People used to rely on libraries, conversations, word-of-mouth
  * No attention to the actual evidence, risks/benefits and their personal differences
  * We really haven't moved any further with WebMD, folks
## 17.2 - Historical Perspective on Consumer Health Informatics
### 17.2.1 - The Rise of Consumer-Oriented Health Communications
* goal: move patients from being passive recipients to actively involved
  * factor in a patient's values, preferences and lifestyle
* US Federal Children's Bureau
  * Mothers would send paper letters to them asking questions
* Primarily through mail, then television shows, videos, etc.
  * "consumer health broadcasts"
  * The OG Dr. Oz ðŸ™„
  * Daytime television and radio shows
* Since the 1940s, hospitals had computerized forms filled out by patients to calculate risk
### 17.2.2 - Early Advances in Consumer Information Sharing and Decision Making
* Self-help and self-monitoring movement
* Focused on education and giving short lists of therapies/treatments to pick from... kinda
* BARN (think DARE, but with games)
  * wow that's a lot of school assemblies
* Internet was also used to educate
  * Games took time to build, but had the best adoption rate
### 17.2.3 - Early Advances in Consumer-Consumer Interaction
* Online coping/support groups having reduced feelings of anxiety/hopelessness and improved coping skills and life expectancy
* The increased used of the internet for consumer education/decisions also comes with a decrease in general quality in health information on the internet
  * No source of moderation/filtering/quality checks; fake news
### 17.2.4 - Early Advances in Consumer Decision-Facilitation
* In the 1970s, there was a move towards more interactive and personalized content
* "just-in-time"
## 17.3 - Current Trends
### 17.3.1 - Consumer-Facing Software
* > "The home and community are fast becoming the most common sites where health care is provided."
| Mode of Engagement | Definition | Examples | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Communication | Patient-patient, computer-patient, patient-provider | Patient portals, Patient-physician emails, online support groups, social networks |
