# Chapter 2: Biomedical Data, Their Acquisition, Storage, and Use 
## Who Collects Data
* Clinicians
	* Can collect data via conversing/observing patients + instrumentation
	* Not just a primary source of the actual recording
		* Also dictates what data is to be recorded next
			* Requests labs, tests, diagnostics, surgeries, imaging, etc.
	* Scribes are cool, but add an intermediary layer between physician and documentation source (EHR)
* Nurses
	* HCPs that receive the most actual face time and interaction with patients
	* observation, history taking, and examination
	* Builds the strongest relationships with patients
  	* opens opportunity for more "honest" patient records and psycho-social observations
*  Other HCPs
  * office/admin staff - demographic, claims, and  financial information
  * Physical/respiratory/occupational therapists - progress, treatments, suggestions
  * Lab personnel - tests
  * Radiology techs - imaging
* Pharmacists - medications, usage, adherence, drug allergies
* Instruments
  * lab machines, imaging, *monitoring*
  * Can export single data points (thermometers), continuous streams (ECGs, CGMonitors) or images (pictures, imaging, etc.)
## Uses of Health Data
* EHRs suck, but they're still somehow better than paper records
  * Theoretically
  * Longitudinal access across an institution would be great; even better across institutions
  * Creates the Basis of a Historical Record
  * record of what health conditions and observations *have* been made
  * allows the care team to look at trends over time
  * history and reoccurence of symptoms/illnesses
  * medications, interventions, decisions, **and reasoning behind them**
  	* hopefully lots of metadata behind each
  * *Allows for the use of population-level insights*
  	* statistical models, similarities, comparisons, analyses
* Support communication among providers
  * historically, a patient only had one doctor from youth to adulthood and saw them for everything
  	* Specialization changed that and fragmented patient-doctor relationships and continuous history
  * Recording patient data leaves a trail and medium for multiple doctors to communicate with each other about a patient through the documentation, patient history and clinical notes
  * Emphasis on the importance of **continuity of care**
* Anticipate future health problems
  * Can use the history to predict/diagnose/create a prognosis of the future
* assists in screening risk factors
  * longitudinal view allows for ease of prescribing interventions (diet/lifestyle changes)
* Record standard preventative measures
  * ie. vaccinations, smoke cessation, safe sex practices, interventions such as dietary changes
* Identify deviations from expected trends
* Provide a legal record
  * safety for life/medical insurances
  * Malpractice coverage
  * other legal actions
* Support clinical research
  * Clinical Trials!
	* Looking at multiple patients' data!
* aggregation, statistics, analyses once again
  * **Retrospective studies** - the good shit
	* Using historical data sets to do research
	* Common in epidemiology
	* Calculating risks of smoking, lung cancer, finding proportions, heart disease, death rates, recidivism/recurrence, etc.
## Weaknesses of traditional medical record system (as in paper charts; ~holy crap how old was the first edition of this book~)
* Recording data aint worth shit if you can't find it later
  * Metrics of "finding" data: resolution (actually finding it), speed, legibility/interpretablity, reliability
  * Metrics also apply to being able to *update* this data
*
