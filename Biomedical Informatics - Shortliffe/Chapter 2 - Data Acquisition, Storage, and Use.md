* **Who Collects Data**
	* Clinicians
		* Can collect data via conversing/observing patients + instrumentation
		* Not just a primary source of the actual recording
			* Also dictates what data is to be recorded next
				* Requests labs, tests, diagnostics, surgeries, imaging, etc.
		* Scribes are cool, but add an intermediary layer between physician and documentation source (EHR)
	* Nurses
		* HCPs that receive the most actual face time and interaction with patients
		* observation, history taking, and examination
