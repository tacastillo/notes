# Chapter 6: Inpatient and Outpatient Services
## Introduction
* **Inpatient Services** - services involve an overnight stay of the patient
  * HC system used to (as in 1800s) be primarily inpatient, with limited outpatient services
* HC system used to be focused on serving the poor/homeless
  * now uses cutting edge technology for the seriously ill and injured
* Outpatient services became more popular as a preventative measure
  * Keeping them healthy is relatively cheaper and less risky than making them healthy again.
  * That's cost containment and patient preferences
* Hospitals can be defined by who owns them, the lengths of stay, and the types of services provided
## History of Hospitals
* Latin *hospitalia* for "host", as in hosting the sick and poor within your home
* French *HÃ´tel-Dieu* for "hotel of God" in the Middle Ages
* Temples were the first type of hospitals: Greek, Egyptian, Hindu, Roman
* Manhattan Island had the first US hospital in 1663
* *almshouses* or *poorhouses* were developed in the 1820s to take care of the poor/homeless
  * First almhouse to turn into a hospital was Philadelphia General Hospital
    * First incorporated hospital was Pennsylvania Hospital
      * Philadelphia also had the first quarantine station for new immigrants
  * Johns Hopkins in Baltimore started off as Public Hospital of Baltimore in 1789, then JHU in 1889

* In 1930s, ownership went from physicians to churches/governments
* 1973 - Patient Bill of Rights - to represent the patient in hospital care
* **(CON) Certificate of Need** - required states to approve any growth/development/construction on hospitals

* 1980 - 87% of hospitals had outpatient surgeries
* 1996 - Hospitalists - physicians focused on hospital stays 
* 1997 - CMS starts initiatives/incentives for hospitals providing outpatient surgeries
* Now - there are just as many ambulatory surgery centers as there are hospitals
  * aka - private practices that happen to do surgery
* 5,600 hospitals in the US
## Hospitals by Type of Ownership
