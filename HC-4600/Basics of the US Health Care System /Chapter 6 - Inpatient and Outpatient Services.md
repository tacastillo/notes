# Chapter 6: Inpatient and Outpatient Services
## Introduction
* **Inpatient Services** - services involve an overnight stay of the patient
  * HC system used to (as in 1800s) be primarily inpatient, with limited outpatient services
* HC system used to be focused on serving the poor/homeless
  * now uses cutting edge technology for the seriously ill and injured
* Outpatient services became more popular as a preventative measure
  * Keeping them healthy is relatively cheaper and less risky than making them healthy again.
  * That's cost containment and patient preferences
* Hospitals can be defined by who owns them, the lengths of stay, and the types of services provided
