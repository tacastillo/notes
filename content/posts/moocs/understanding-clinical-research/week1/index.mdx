# What are the different clinical study types?
* Key Concepts:
  * Observational vs Experimental studies
  * Observational
    * Case studies
    * Case-control studies
    * Cross-sectional studies
    * Cohort studies
  * Experimental
  * Meta-analysis and systematic review
## Observing and Intervening: Observational & Experimental Studies
* Two main types of research: **Observational studies** and **experimental studies/trials**
* Observational
  * maintaining the status quo
  * subjects and *variables* are observed
  * no treatment or intervention
  * day-to-day results/data
    * capturing and analyzing this data
  * Types
    * Case - data on a single group and describe the set (of patients, etc.)
    * Case-control - data on two groups, control and a group to analyze
    * Cross-sectional - ex. surveys
    * Cohort - following a group of people over a period of time
* Experimental studies
  * try something new, and analyze the results of this produced data
    * requires a pre-designated plan
    * healthcare works must change their existing routine and follow the plan based on study design
  * typically involves at least two groups with different paths
  * "the main idea behind an experimental study is to remove bias"
    * this is a little blurry to me, but hopefully I'll figure it out
  * if it involves people, it's a **clinical trial**
  * Ways to augment an experiment
    * Controls - control group/placebo/sham
    * blinding - patient/observers - what treatment is received
    * randomization
  * Types
    * Independant concurrent controls
    * Trials with self-controls
    * Trials with external controls
    * Uncontrolled trials
* Meta-analysis + Systematic reviews
  * super important in the current world for doing research on/with existing research
  * Meta-analysis
    * use pre-existing research and combines their results to an obtain and overall conlusions
    * aims to overcome a very common problem -  **small sample sizes** - which led to *underpowered* results
    * a part of a systematic review
  * Systematic review
    * literature review that sums up the best available on a specific research question
    * includes research results, published guidelines, expert (group) opinion and **meta-analyses**

## Case Series Studies
* Simplest form of research
* can be called *case series* or *audit*
* value is identify problems, areas of interest
  * helps plan further research
* ex. HIV Encephalopathy
  * describe the set of set patients
  * challenges they/their parents face
  * opportunities to improve their lives
  * layout
    * went to a clinic and picked 87 children with the condition
    * defined a set variables beforehand to track (age, gender, type of labor, developmental problems, etc.)
  * results are just describing the results of the data collection and of the data
    * overview of the stats collected from the metrics
## Case-Control Studies
* More than one group - case group and control group
* groups vary by a variable
* identify differences and risk factors between the two groups
* Choose a spot in time and look backwards
* ex. atopic (allergy disease) in toddler
  * two groups: with atopic disease and without
  * looks at historical data on the patients in each group
  * look at variables (delivery type, breastfeeding, family history, etc.
    * and compare and contrast the variables between the groups
* problems
  * bias - is it generalizable to the whole population 
    * ie. in toddler study, clinic was for high socioeconomically ranked
  * confounding - possible hidden causes
    * correlation does not lead to causation with these differences
* **Confounding Factor** - a third variable which is associated to both the outcome (disease) and a potentially linked variable (risk factor)
  * ie. COPD (disease), alcohol consumption (risk factor)
    * oh, but you *also* have a history of smoking! (confounding factor)
  * to combat, you need to run a separate study which controls for the confounding factors
    * but you can have dozens of confounding factors, so lol
## Cross-sectional Studies
* an example: surveys
  * take a snapshot of a population at a time
    * or short period of time (ie. duration of the campaign/study)
  * also epidemiological surveys - how many patients at any given time have a disease
* can be incorporated to other study designs
* ex. questionnaire for optometrists
  * what advice would give a specific type of patient
  * forms many sub-groups
  * compare and contrasts answer from these groups
* problems
  * response bias - certain subset of actual population that replies may skew data
  * separating cause and effect is hard
    * separating as in defining whether one is a cause vs an effect in the first place
    * once again, correlation vs causation
    * confounding factors!!!
* very cheap and easy to conduct
## Cohort Studies
* **cohort** - a group of patients that share a common trait
  * *the key* - identify them and follow up over time
    * that's the difference between a case study
* case studies are historical, whereas cohorts are future-drive
* ex. mother:child pairs and track development of pneumonia
* could be a short period of time (5 days after a procedure was done)
* *retrospective* vs *prospective* data **collection/acquisition**
  * driven by when the data is collected, not analyzed
  * retrospective - used in case/case-control studies
    * based on existing data of the patients
  * prospective - more common for cohort studies
    * identify patients for trial/study at the beginning of the study
    * collect data as time continues
    * also prevalent in cross-sectional studies
  * gray area with EHRs and driven boxes towards structured data points
## Experimental Studies
* Ex. Randomised, Double-Blind, Controlled Vaccine Efficacy Trial Against Malaria in Gambian Adults
  * Two groups: experimental and placebo group
    * experimental group got two malaria vaccines
    * placebo group got rabies vaccines so they were able to still benefit from being part of the study
  * called an **active intervention**
  * Took volunteers (not completely random/unbiases)
* can test multiple variables/interventions at once and that's fine as long it's one per group
* *"Reduce Bias"* - still no clue what that means
* **Randomization** - each person in a population should have equal likelihood to be a participant
  * not just for defining groups, but also the *whole* sample
  * look at your data sources: ie. clinics (can be geriatric-focused), public vs private hospitals, region, location, etc.
* **Blinding** - subject and experimenter
  * norm to blind the subject (subject doesn't know what intervention they're taking/what group they're in)
  * experimenter/caregivers - easy for drugs, hard for procedures (can't blind a surgeon)
    * the importance is in blinding the person *collecting and analyzing the data*
      * called the observer
* **Forms of Control**
  * Self-controlled - collect data, perform intervention, collect data from same variables
    * independent concurrent controls - controls are included during the course of the experiement and data is collected at the same time
      * basically, a subject can't be in both groups
    * Crossover trial - subtype after a period of time, swap the groups that the subject is in
      * collect data, perform intervention, collect data, period of reset, stop intervention/start placebo, collect data
      * patients act as a control against themselves
  * External controls - intervention is done to the whole group, and is compared to something outside the trial (like the past)
    * *historical control* is when you compare groups with groups tested earlier in time
    * important if no treatment existed before the trial
  * Uncontrolled trials - look at a variety of drugs and outcomes and aggregate into groups after the experiment is over
* Gold standard is a *double-blind randomized control trial*
  * most powerful, largest quantity, and most trustworthy information
*
