# Week 4 - Change Management
## Key Concepts
* Describe twhy workflow re-engineering is essential in healthcare
* Recall the PDSA (Plan Do Study Act) Cycle)
* Recognize the approach to workflow redesign when putting a health IT intervention into place.
* Distinguish between the "phases approach" vs "big bang" when it comes to go-lives
* Incorporate best practice in change management to mitigate risks
## Change Management
### Change Management
* Own up to mistakes, falling behind, or being in the red
* Don't have too few tests, but also don't have too many that your Go Live date seems unreasonable
### Push vs. Pull
* how to communicate change
* Push change - top down and comes from leaders; imposing change
  * performance targets and financial incentives
* Pull change - bottom up; based on stakeholders
### Workflow Redesign/Re-engineering
* Important to understand and analyze the existing workflow
  * Consider best practices for the workflow
  * many moving parts in healthcare as a whole
    * making a change in one part may impact other parts
* Patients lives are at stake here
### Definitions and Guidelines
* **Workflow** -  sequence of physical and mental tasks performed by various people within and between work environments
  * Swim lane workflow sequence diagrams are common
* **Workflow Redesign/Re-engineer** - to reorganize the operations to improve efficiency 
* Triple Aim: improve patient outcomes, reduce costs, improve population health
#### Institute of Medicine's 10 Rules for Redesign
1. Knowledge is shared and information flows freely
2. Cooperation amongst clinicians
3. Safety is a system priority
4. Transparency is necessary
5. Evidence-based decision making
6. Anticipate patient's needs
7. Care is customized according to patient needs and values
8. Care is baed on continuous healing relationships
9. The patient is the source of control
10. Waste is decreased
### Define the Problem
### Plan the Solution
* Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) Cycle
* Plan
* Analyze the problem
  * Ask the frontline staff
  * Ishikawa (Fishbone) Diagram
    * Root Cause Analysis - why did the patient die
    * list out of causes
  * Ask "Why" 5 times
  * Create a sequence diagram
* Form a team
  * formed from members of different parts of the sequence/proces
* Define metrics of success
  * ie. decrease missed appointments by 5%
* Propose and informatics solution
  * Revisit the IHI Triple Aim
### Implement
* The "Do" portion of the PDSA cycle
* Phased roll out (with pilot) vs big bang
  * Choose an appropriate site for the pilot
  * Change the information system to support the redesigned workflow
* "Big Bang" rollout
  * launch everything at once at all sites
  * needed if there are too many interdependent parts
    * could be the only option
* Phased with pilot - start at a small unit or clinic and see from there
  * Choose the site where the pilot will have the maximum impact
    * Best combination of easy to do and highest payoff
* Five Rights to CDS
  1. Right information
  2. Right person
  3. Right format
  4. Right channel
  5. Right time in the workflow
### Analyze and Iterate
* Aka, "Study and Act"
* Study
  * Analyze the data and study the results
  * Compare the data to your predictions
  * Reflect on what is learned
* Act
  * What modifications should be made?
  * Prepare a plan for the next test
* Agile
  * Important to re-convene and check in periodically with champions, stakeholders and users
  * before building a production system, build a flexible information system that you can change and test out
* Three components
  * Data and source
  * Method of analysis
  * Delivery of information
* Pilot vs production
  * Excel vs auto-extraction in EMR
  * MATLAB scripts vs server code
  * printed lists vs automated paging
  * Pilot should be easy to alter algorithms and pivot vs rigid, automated and scalable in production
* Don't be afraid to walk back
  * Re-engineer to the purpose, not to the process
### Key Takeaways
* Making a change is easy in comparison to *sustaining* the change
  * Capture, share and celebrate short-term wins
  * Congratulate and recognize your frontline workers
* Caution: Safe handling of PHI
### Workarounds
* If an EHR won't let you put in a medication over its therapeutic cap (100mg), then put it in as 2 orders (60mg and 60mg)
### Change Management in Software
* Three types of change:
  * Organizational change
  * Changes to a project management plan
  * Changes in software development
* Why is this important?
  * Keep things within scope, budget and expected quality
  * Change management helps us respect this triple constraint in any process
* DOCUMENT YOUR CHANGES
* Use versioning
* Keep track of requirement updates
* See how it impacts the UX
* Things to track
  * Description of the change request
  * Who requested it
  * Priority of item
  * Who is responsible for implementing the change
  * Date change was implemented
* ...just use JIRA.
### Managing Change: A Developer's Perspective
* Give documentation and access to resources for stakeholders(clinicians) to understand the changes and why they're happening
* Don't let your users think changes are being imposed on them, but rather the system is involving them as its evolving
### Closing Remarks
* Data stewardship - the management and facilitation of data
* Moving people from being siloed data owners to being stewards of the data!
* vexing issues of interoperability, usability, privacy, security, and data stewardship
