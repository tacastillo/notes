# Week 3
## Key Concepts
* Describe the role of strategic planning from the perspective of at least three different health information systems
* Distinguish between the utility of commonly used strategic planning tools.
* Produce a relevant list of fifteen external STEEP factors that can impact a given health information system.
* Calculate total cost of ownership and return on investment.
* Utilize a vendor evaluation matrix tool to make a recommendation on purchasing.
## Essentials for Strategic Planning for Health Information Systems
### Strategic Planning
* Strategic planning is "build vs buy" decisions
* Try not to build your own things; Hopkins isn't a software development shop
  * Allows you to focus on working only on the things that are most important
* Don't rush into the vendor selections
  * Don't show your cards too early or be too eager
* Benchmarking: evaluating best practices of other organizations
* RFI, RFP, RFQ: Request for (information, proposal, quote)
### Case Study in Strategic Planning
* Got free Apple Watches because Apple was interested in what they were doing
* Many projects start without thinking far enough ahead about where the project will go
  * Have to think several steps ahead
    * If it goes well, but also be able to adjust to changes in things such as *clinical guidelines*
### A Strategic Acquisition
* Nothing much
### Strategic Planning Tools
#### SWOT
* Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
  * examines *internal* strengths and weaknesses
  * along with *external* opportunities and threats facing the organization
* seeks to mitigate negative factors and leverage positive factors
* Primary question SWOT seeks to answer:
  * Where do we focus internal capability given the external, competitive environment?
#### Scenario Planning
* Can be used to idenitfy visionary options in times of uncertainty
* tool allows planners to portray a series of plausible alternative futures methodically
* each scenario tells a story of how various forces might interact under certain conditions
* Planners design scenarios to open up new ways of thinking about the future and provide a platform for strategic dialogue -- new questions, new conversions -- as the basis for strategic actions
* Primary question scenario planning seeks to answer:
  * How can we survive (or prosper) no matter what the future brings?
#### Choosing the Right Tool
* SWOT is best suited for *more stable, moderately challenging* situations
* Scenario planning is more relevant for *uncertain, highly challenging* environments facing most healthcare entities
#### Questions to Ask Yourself When Picking a Tool
* Address these concepts:
  * Future Uncertainties
  * Stress Test - How well will our current strategic initiatives fare?
  * Portfolio of Strategic Initiatives: What are our mission-critical choices in the short, medium and longer-term?

* What are the **STEEP** factors that could dramatically change our operating or external environment
  * Social, Technological, Environmental, Economic, Political
### Tele-Emergency Medicine: Interview with Junaid Ruzak
### Interview: Rebecca Canino and Dr. Ingrid Zimmer-Galler
* Setting up infrastructure and a framework for building stuff
  * so you don't have to re-invent the wheel every time
### Medical Second Opinion Program
* Look at non-reimbursed services
* International healthcare
## Vendor Evaluations and Financial Considerations
### Vendor Evaluation Process
* Some possible vendors:
  * EMR, Telemedicine, blockchain, NLP, population health, data security, cloud vendor
#### Important Things to Consider
* Assessing functionality/usability of different vendors
* determine priorities for your organization
* score each vendor, tally up overall scores
* Questions to Ask:
  * What are the key requirements we need from this?
  * Who are our stakeholders? CAn we have clinical champions who can help us gather and determine key requirements?
  * Do we need a thick client (desktop app) or a thin client (web app)
  * How do we engage more than just our clinical champions? The more feedback we get, the better.
#### RFIs and RFPs
* RFIs and RFPs are a key part of the vendor selection process
  * RFI - helps you gather information from vendors and identify vendors you want to invite for an RFP
  * RFP - demo phase; great to detail your key requirements you have from the vendor and be able to compare proposals
    * important to get at least 3 proposals
    * always allow for a two-sided Q&A afterwards
  * RFP++ - an enhanced way to do an RFP
    * ask for demo environments and have your actual users/clinical champions test it out themselves
### ROI
* Definition: MEasurement of expected benefits from the investment (financial and non-financial)
* Average net benefit (net cash flow) divided by capital investment
* Only include hard benefits
* used to assist with decision making and creating business cases
* Used to evaluate performance improvement
#### Process to Determine ROI
1. Identify/estimate all costs benefits prior to implementation
2. Set attainable goals/targets
3. Monitor progress
4. At the end of the project, identify costs and benefits
5. Compare to pre-implementation
6. Document/share your success
7. Repeat
### Calculating Total Cost of Ownership
* Not just upfront costs, but also maintenance, training, licenses, duration, etc.
* Contracts don't always end at the expected time, so be prepared to pay more if there's license creep
