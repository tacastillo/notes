# Key Concepts
* Articulate concerns of healthcare policy and their relationships to informatics
* Identify new models of healthcare and their relationship to informatics
* Distinguish different levels of interoperability
* Distinguish among health information privacy, confidentiality and security
* Articulate reasons for, and frameworks of, informatics evaluation
# World, Organization, Roles, Function
* The "What" should be defining the "how", or may cause conflict
* Clinical and Societal goals are different
  * Clinical: prevent, identify, and treat illness; maximize QoL with chronic conditions, treat exacerbations, manage death
  * Societal: significantly improve the health and wel-being of populations, reduce health inequities, strengthen public health, ensure sustainable people-centered health
* Emergent properties of population health
  * Typically, the ROI is linear when calculating impacts (adding up comorbities leads to comorbidity rate in a community)
  * Emergent properties are non-linear, like vaccinations - after 80%, the whole community is vaccinated
* Triple Aim
  * Improve patient experience
  * Reduce cost
  * Improve Population Health
  * Quadruple Aim - Reduce clinician burden
# Policy: New Models
* MACRA program created new models of care
* CMS "Quality Measure Goals"
  * Vision: patient-centered, high quality care
  * safe, effective, transparent, efficient, smooth transitions of care, eliminating disparities
  * Externally and interally derived measures: evidence-based care and measures
  * 1/3 of care is paid by the US government (Medicare, Medicaid)
    * Provider submits a claim => government pays it back
* MACRA is all about incentivizations and increased reimbursement rates for Medicare/Medicaid actions 
  * Evidence of quality => higher payments, evidence of poor quality/no evidence => lower payments
  * Quality evidence reporting ensures good quality care
  * MIPS (Merit-based incentivize programs)
* New Models of Care Delivery
  * ACOs (Accountable Care Organizations)
  * PCMHs
  * Health Homes
  * Telemedicine
  * Retail clinics (or urgent cares)
  * Community-based solutions
* CMS set the rules and precedence, and so many private payers are following up with it too
  * V important
* IT is needed to measure this evidence; could be used for intervention too
* ACO Information Technology
  * Patient portals - asynchronous care!
  * EHRs - CDS, integration across silos
* Potential ACO Ethical Issues
  * Unintended financial effects
  * patient autonomy and cost savings, privacy Issues, engagement
  * provider - professional autonomy, dual responsibility, sense of competition
  * leaders - resource allocation, ethical obligations, fair decision processes
# Policy: Other Models
* Each perspective has different goals
* **Are you a patient or a population item?**
* Social determinants of health!
  * Economic stability
  * social and community context
  * education
  * neighborhood
  * health and healthcare
* Persona user studies are very important in health informatics!
# Interoperability
* What started as a technical issue has turned into a policy issue
* Pairwise interoperability is not scalable
* Interoperability requires connection at each level across the stack
* We have a sense of what it is, how it would work, but not how to get it to work
### Privacy, Confidentiality, Security
* Three different concepts that exist at different parts of the stack
* Privacy is a policy concept
* HIPAA
  * Covered entities (providers, payers)
  * overruled for:
    * GSW, stab wounds, injuries in a crime, infectious/communicable/reportable disease, child/elder abuse
* Security is a how/technology aspect
* Confidentiality, integrity, availability of data
* HIPAA Safeguards
  * Administrative, physical, technical
  * exists across the stack
* HIPAA Privacy Rule
  * 18 "Safe Harbor" data elements
  * Limited Data set
    * No identifying information
    * full dates, city, state, zip, and age
* Ongoing Issues
  * Should people who contribute to data sets be compensated?
  * Are adolescents adults or children?
  * Are family members put at risk by sharing your information? Think HeLa cells
  * What about GDPR?
  * Can law enforcement use/access your health data?
  * Accounting for disclosures?
  * What non-health data are really health data? ie. Social determinants (location, jail time, etc.)
  * HIPAA doesn't cover patient-generated data
# Evaluation
* Is what you did any good?
* Definition
  * Does what you did at the lower half of the stack accomplish what you need for the top half of the stack?
* IT has a problem of evaluating what is easy, but not what needs to be measured
* Basics of Evaluation
  * Y is what you want to minimize or maximize
    * ex. mortality, morbidity, cost, efficiency
  * X are causes that lead to Y
    * N-to-1 relationship of Xs to Ys
    * Things to either fix or celebrate
  * Z are confounders
* Examples of Xs, Ys, and Zs
  * PRISM framework for evaluating health outcomes in developing countries
    * Xs are environmental, technical and behavioral determinants
    * Ys are improved health system performance and therefore improved health outcomes
* Data used to measure Xs and Ys can come from inside or outside the system
  * Deaths are often not tracked within the system
