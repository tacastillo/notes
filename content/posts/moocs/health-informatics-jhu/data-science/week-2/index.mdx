# Week 2 - Data Sources and Data Challenges
## Key Concepts
* Describe the common sources of health data, specifically insurance claims and electronic health records
* Identify major population-level sources of health data such as APCD, HCUP and PCORnet
* Review the common challenges of health data including data quality, interoperability, and system architecture
* Describe various perspectives of "Big Data" and explain its implications for health analytics
## Common Clinical Data Sources
### Billing/Claims Data
| Advantages | Disadvantages | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Covers data across multiple providers | Only contains Dx, Rx and Tx (lacks lab values, vital signs, family history, etc.) |
| Higher consistency of data format | Limited to insured patients |
| Large-scale data sets are available (BlueButton) | Anything not covered is missing |
#### Insurance Data: Hospitals
* Hospital claims, often referred to as facility claims, can be broadly categorized as inpatient and outpatient
  * Inpatient - admission to a facility
  * Outpatient - ER visits, ambulatory surgeries, check ups, in-n-outs
* Often use a format called UB04 (Uniform Billing) (paper)
  * Fields are consistent even when switching electronically
#### Insurance Data: Physician Claims Data
* Not just clinicians; also NPs, therapists, etc.
  * CMS 1500 Form
* For any given encounter, 2 claims could be filled: one for the facility usage (Hospital) and one for the services provided (Physician)
#### Insurance Data: Pharmacy
* Relatively straightforward
* Outpatient drugs are given an NDC (National Drug Code)
* Prescriptions that are prescribed but not filled do not generate claims
* Absence of Dx in the data
* Pharmacy Benefits Manager (PBM) works between the payer and the patient/provider
  * ie. CVS Health
* Other ways to get medication data
  * EHRs, Surescripts, Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP)
### EHR Data
| Advantages | Disadvantages | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Includes lab values, vitals, social determinants, etc.| Not longitudinal; only carries data from one provider |
| Covers things not covered by insurance | Lower consistency, also has free text |
| Insured and uninsured patients | Large-scale datasets are hard to find |
* Meaningful Use has helped
* Lack of interoperability makes it hard to work with
* Lacking longitudinal data (only from one provider)
* Common population-level health data types in EHRs:
  * Demographics, Dx and problem lists, Procedures, Rx, social determinants, vital signs, immunization records, surveys, patient-reported outcomes, clinical notes
* Non-traditional sources of Population-Level Data  
  * Patient-provided/-generated outcomes
  * Public health/vital records
  * Social services
  * Environmental/Geographical
  * Resource availability
  * Consumer/Non-medical
  * HIE
## Population-Level Data
* APCD - All-Payer Claims Data
  * state-wide claims data, increasing adoption
* CMS Data
  * Medicare - 44m
  * Medicaid - CHIP, low-income parents, pregnancy, disabilities, low-income seniors
* Commercial Insurance Claims databases
  * IMS, Optum, Truven, FAIR Health
* Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW)
  * the VA
* Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP)
  * AHRQ-funded, a whole bunch of discharge registries!
  * National Inpatient Sample (NIS) - largest publicly available all-payer hospital inpatient care database
  * Kid's Inpatient Database (KID) - inpatient stays for children
  * Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS) - outpatient ED visits
  * Nationwide Readmissions Database - readmissions across both payers and uninsured patients
  * State Inpatient Databases (SIDs) - 
  * State Emergency Department Databases (SEDDs) - outpatient ED visits
* PCORnet - Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network
  * regional; EHR-based
  * 29 internal networks and Coordinating Center
    * 155 organizations and millions of patients
* mHealth Platforms
  * SMART and HealthKit lol
* Large-scale surveys
  * lots from the CDC
* Look at non-health related data sets, too
  * social data, GIS data, marketing data, financial data
## Data Challenges I
### Key Takeaways
* Examine how data quality affects clinical operation and research
* Analyze data interoperability challenges that may hinder operations and research
### Data Management Challenges
* Quality - Accuracy, completeness, timeliness
  * Conversion errors, shitty games of telephones, etc.
  * claims data often isn't timely because it can get rejected, revised, etc.
  * Practicality - access to it might be difficult
* Linkage and integration - interoperability and MPI
  * how well data can link/be used together
  * MPI is tough because these identifying features are protected via HIPAA/PHI
* Data system architecture and design - centralized vs federated/distributed models
  * federated - an MPI is needed
* Data access, prviacy and use challenges
  * PHI, HIPAA
## Data Challenges II
### Key Takeaways
* Identify challenges in using various Big Data sources for analytic purposes
### Big Data
* 5V data specifications:
  * Volume: data quantity (size, length)
  * Variety: data types (structure, standardization, ontology)
  * Velocity: data refresh Frequency (real-time, timeliness)
  * Veracity: data quality (accuracy, completeness)
  * Value: add-value of data (cost, feasibility, governance)
### Health Analytic Process
1. Database Development
2. Data Preparation
3. Modeling and Data Mining
4. Model Validation and Evaluation
5. Use of Knowledge
6. Generate New Data
### Challenges with Big Data
* High data volume
  * Relational might not work
    * Columnar (Redshift), Graph (GraphQL), NoSQL (Mongo), Document-based (ElasticSearch)
* High data variety
  * Data lakes!
* High data velocity
  * Streaming data?
* Complex Data Veracity
  * Nullness? Completeness?
* Ambiguous Value
* What happens if you have the entire population in your "sample"?
  * Sampling algorithms are no good anymore
## Data Challenges III
* Explain denominator selection challenges
* List privacy challenging when using health data
* Identify other challenges for using clinical/health data
### Denominator and Variable Selection
* Denominator selection - features that match a certain criteria
  * special age, special conditions, disabilities, etc.
  * who is your target sample within your population?
* Timeframe selection - length of the training data set, test data set
* Outcome selection - cost, mortality, admission, hospitalization, readmission, etc.
* Feature/factor selection and reduction
  * Minimizes factors used without producing skewness
* Purpose - are you using the data for the right purpose
### Data Access and Privacy Challenges
* Certain data is protected (PHI)
* Must use techniques to avoid putting PHI into your models
  * Date shifting, obfuscating, using only the first 3 digits of the zip code, etc.
* Makes MPIs pointless because you can't link your federated/distributed data sources together
### Other Data Challenges
* Process of care - different providers generate different data values
  * Can create noise in modeling
* Nature of intervention - different interventions with different levels of risk may be encoded similarly
  * Two different interventions are denoted by the same code (ie. amount of anesthesia)
* Random chance or external factors - two exactly similar patients may develop two different risk profiles due to chance
