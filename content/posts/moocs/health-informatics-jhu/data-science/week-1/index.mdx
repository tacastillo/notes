# Week 1 - Introduction to Databases and Data Types
## Key Concepts
* Describe common health data types (eg. demogrpahics, diagnosis, and medications) and explain their advantages and disadvantages
* Describe various emerging health data types (eg. labs, vital signs and social data) and review the potential challenges in using them
* Identify the key characteristics of databases
* Identify the role of databases in the clinical informatics environment
## Introduction to Databases
### Informatics Definition of "Database"
* Regular collection of data
  * consistent columns/schema
* Computerized record-keeping system
* collection of stored operational (And relational) data used by application systems of an enterprise
* Any collection of related data that is:
  * Persistent - a patient is a patient
  * Logically coherent
  * Comprising inherently meaningful data
  * relevant to some aspects of the real world
### A whole buncha history
### Components of an SQL Server
#### Server
* Operating system - linux, windows, etc.
* server software - mySQL, Postgres
* Database - object, tables, indexes
* Security - server level logins and users
  * not always 1:1 between login and users
* Management: backups/agent jobs
#### Client
* Connection protocol - TCPIP, OLEDB, ODBC, JDBC
* Used by applications - ORMs, websites, servers, excel
### Summary
* Database - collection of related data that is persistent, logically coherent, comprising inherently meaningful data, and relevant to some aspects of the real world
* relational database - designed in terms of relating sets of data together
* client <-> server: topology we will use, most common platform of relational databases
* SQL - structured query language - relational
## Databases in Clinical Informatics
* Don't forget the Informatics Stack
* Databases fit below the line in the informatics stack (how)
* Example - "I need a database for TB cases"
  * Why? clinical, admin, or research purposes?
  * Databases don't worry about this, that's above the line
### Privacy, Confidentiality and Security
* Privacy - the ability to keep information about yourself secret - laws, regulation, trust
* Confidentiality - the prevention of data loss - access, identity management, authentication, authorization, permissions
* Security - integrity of the data system and network - encryption, keys, firewalls, VPNs, theft, hacking, intrusion, DDOS, trojans
### Interfaced EHR
* Distributed network
  * LIS is separate from the EHR
* Even the EHR is segmented
  * pharmacy stuff is separated from clinical stuff which is separated from appointment stuff
* Easier to adopt practices for each individual system because they're disjointed
  * updating to a new version of FHIR, or a new data model would be easier here since you're not touching anything else
* Analytics is more difficult
* Has an interface engine in the middle that you interact with
### Integrated EHR
* Centralized databases all in one spot
* might be overkill for many facilities
* Hard to maintain
* Higher requirements for adoption
## Common Data Types I
### Key Takeaway
* Identify various data types used for clinical research, including both traditional (ie. common) and non-traditional (ie. emerging) data types)
### Common Data Types
* Demographics (age, sex, gender)
* Diagnoses ( diagnosis, severity)
* Medications (prescription, dispense, order)
* Procedures (inpatient, outpatient)
* Surveys (Patient health Questionnaire v.9, RedCap, SurveyMonkey)
* Utilization (cost, hospitalization)
### Data Type Specs - General Structure
* Variables - list of common variables for this data type
* Background - general trend in the population
* Derived variables - different methods used to extract derived variables from this data type
  * extract prescription pattern and adherence from medications
* Coding standards - common coding conventions for this data type (eg ICD, SNOMED< RxNorm, DSM, NDC, ATC)
* Data Sources - common data sources containing this data type
  * claims, EHR, HIEs
* Data quality - typical data quality issues with this data type
* Data interoperability - specific interoperability issues that may affect the collection, integration and sharing of this particular data type
* Legal considerations - issues with privacy and security that may impact accessing or utilizing this data type
  * HIPAA
### Demographics
* Variables - age, sex, gender, location, family, name, etc.
* Background - increasing life expectancy in the US
* Derived variables - age groups (ranges, brackets, Medicare eligible)
* Coding standards - available but not commonly used; age is often coded as DOB or age in years
  * Sex is usually 0 (unknown), 1 (female), 2 (male), or 9 (N/A or other)
* Data sources - multiple patient-level data sources including claims, EHR, HIEs and others
* Data quality - typically has an acceptable data quality due to various mandates to collect them accurately
* Data interoperability - N/A, sufficient due to consistent enough coding standards (except gender)
* Legal considerations - age, but not sex, is HIPAA protected
## Common Data Types II
### Diagnoses
* Variables - diagnosis (diseases, symptoms, injuries, health status factors, family history)
* Background - chronic disease are on the rise
* Derived Variables - severity, trajectory, history, location, etc.
* Coding standards - available and commonly used (ICD-10, LOINC, SNOMED, DSM)
* Data sources - patient-level data sources (clinical or claims data)
* Data quality - acceptable data quality due to mandates to collect them accurately; quality differs across data sources
* Data interoperability - mapping from one system to another, or one version to another (ICD-9 to ICD-10)
  * Mapping is difficult though
* Legal considerations - certain diagnostic codes (HIV, GSW, mental illness) are protected under federal and state laws
### Medications (and Procedures, I Guess)
* Variables - prescribed (EHR) and filled (claims)
* Background - certain medications have an overall higher cost
* Derived Variables - medication adherence (ex. polypharmacy, medical regiment complexity index, medication possession ratio)
* Coding Standards - RxNorm, NDCs, SNOMED C-Axis, ATC, Medispan, Multum, GPI, FDB
* Data sources - clinical, claims, prescription benefit management, surescripts, prescription drug monitoring program
* Data Quality - mandated data quality; quality differs across systems
* Data interoperability - mapping from one system to another
* Legal Considerations - certain medications may reveal sensitive information or diagnoses
## Common Data types III
### Procedures
* ...Pretty much like the other data types... except ICD-CM, and CPT
### Surveys
* No real coding standards, HRA, PHQ-9, GAD-7
* Real flexible
* Quality is difficult: sampling/selection bias, non-response bias, social desiribility bias, validity/reliability issues
### Utilization
* How patients are using clinical resources
* Cost, emergency room admission, hospitalization, readmission
  * Derived variables, 30-, 60-day readmission
## Emerging Data Types
### Lab Data
* Lab orders - was previously not available at the population level
* Could help derive diagnosis severity and missing diagnoses
* There is LOINC, but most EHRs use their own bespoke coding systems
* labs require lots of domain knowledge
  * lots of data pruning and manipulating
  * device error, cleaning, different decimals
  * units
### Vital Signs
* Variables - height, weight, BMI, blood pressure, temperature
* long term trends and risks
* LOINC, but no one really uses it
* Quality is questionable due to human error (BP sitting vs BP standing)
* interoperability - often mismatching units and other data quality issues
* Variations
  * variations in physiology
  * subjective biase (pain level)
  * measurement errors (unreliable tool/instrument)
  * Data capture errors
  * Data interoperability issues
### Social Data
* variables - smoking status, alcohol consumption, addictive behaviors, socioeconomic status
* risk scores
* treatment affordability
* no coding systems
* low data quality
* no interoperability
* more survey-based
### Patient-generated data
* physical activity, mobile/wearable device, patient-reported symptoms
* no standards
* lots of derivable data
* more non-standard devices/apps because not monitored by the FDA
