# Week 3 - Using Transactional and Summative Data and Knowledge for Decision Support
## Key Concepts
* Explain the role of standards in building healthcare informatics interventions.
* Describe the basics of making knowledge computational
* Describe why and how to monitor healthcare interventions put into place
## What's in a Rule?
### Using Knowledge at the Point of Care
### Widgets
* Provide Information
  * target reference, including contextually releveant medical references of info buttons
### Knowledge Base as a Set of Files
* Targeted reference, including contextually relevant medical information references or info buttons: PDFs/URLs to info
* Procedure refreshers, training and reminders: Videos
### Implicit Knowledge: Programs
* IF-THEN statements
  * knowledge is maintained with the program
  * If a guideline changes, so does the program
* Implicit Knowledge
  * Order facilitators (order sets, order consequents, order modifiers)
  * Extended-time guildeline and protocol followers
  * Relevant data displays
  * Smart documentation forms
### Explicit Knowledge: Rules
* Explicit knowledge
  * Task assistants for tasks such as drug dosing and acknowledging laboratory results
  * Reactive alerts
  * Diagnostic suggestions
  * Patient summaries for ahnd-offs between clinicians
  * Performance dashboards with prompts for areas needing attention
  * Tracking and management systems that facilitate task prioritization
### Rule Example
### Information Around the Rule
* Purpose
* Explanation
* Who takes responsibility for the rule?
* Sources of knowledge?
* Date tested
* When is it triggered?
### More Subtle Information
* How to link terms in the rule to data in the EHR?
* Who makes the decision on how to write the rule? 
* Is the way that it's written consistent?
  * If it's modified, how do we make sure everything existing is consistent
* What other precedence is there/What do other institutions do?
### Consequent Rule
* IF critical risk, THEN recommend exchange transfusion
### More Complicated Rule
* IFs and ANDs and ORs
* Wow ok, so conditional logic
### Alert Rule
* If allergic to pencillin, then give an alert
* But allergic to pencillin is it's own rule:
  * If pencillin is in "Field Allergies", then allergic to pencillin === true
## The Lanugage of Rules
* Ontologies are needed to make rules work properly
* This is why people use ICD-10, SNOMED, LOINC, CPT, etc.
## Data Dictionary and Taxonomy
* Formulary - list of medications that a clinician orders
* "Concept" column is more stable across institutions
  * "No more what you call Celexa, it's still an antidepressant"
### Strengths and Weaknesses
* **Strengths**: Simple structure/Database tools to manage
* **Weaknesses**: Can't be complex "LHS => RHS"
  * Connections/graphs can't be made
    * "Cephalexin **is a** cephalesporin"
### Taxonomy
* Hierarchy of Concepts
* **is-a** relationships
* MeSH (Medical Subject Heading) uses taxonomies to make it easier to search through publications such as PubMed
## Value Sets
* Definition: set of codes/concepts
* IF patient's diagnosis is in {dx1, dx2, ... dxn} THEN do this
### Use Cases
* Rules
* Quality indicators (numerator/denominator)
* Cohort discovery: inclusion/exclusion criteria
#### "Computable Phenotype"
* Phenotype: something that is observable
* Computable Phenotype: Atomic piece of data in a cell/concept/code
* NIH has a "Value Set Authority Center"
  * Has a pre-defined reposity of stewarded, verified and collected value sets
* Each organization might have their own value sets
  * There are some leading figures in value set definitions
  * You want to pick the one that most aligns with your goals
  * Literature, eMERGE project, CDISC, PCORnet
## Semantic Networks
* A taxonomy graph, rather than a tree
* is-a, contains
  * MANY other different types of relationships
    * "is measured by", "has method", "has time aspect", "has specimen"
* How you navigate a network changes the outcome
  * path-dependent
* LOINC and SNOMED can be integrated together through these networks
* Errors in SNOMED
  * Smoker - agent? person? role?
  * Lots of inconsistencies
## Ontologies
* Purpose: separate domain knowledge from operational knowledge; provide an engine for web-based communications; ensure consistency/completeness
* Definition: how things are structured and layered
* Has high-level and low-level concepts
* BioPortal - repo of ontologies
* Important question is how wide of a net you want to cast with your ontology
* Common for practices to ship out patient data and add ontological metadata to them
