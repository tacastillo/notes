# Biostatistical Analyses Commonly Used in Research
## The Statistics Tutor's Quick Guide
### Section 1: General Information
* Variable Types
  * Scale (measuresments or counts)
    * Continuous (any value, ie. height)
    * Discrete (specific set of values)
  * Categorical (buckets, tick boxes)
    * Ordinal (has an obvious order, ie. Likert scales)
    * Categorical (no meaningful order, ie. gender)
* Summary Statistics
  * Types of averages and their measure of spread
    * Normally distributed
      * use mean and standard deviation as measure of spread
    * Skewed data
      * use median and IQR
  * Categorical
    * Ordinal
      * use median and IQR
    * Nominal
      * use Mode (no way to measure spread as no order)
  * Charts
| Chart | Variable Type | Purpose | Summary Statistics
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Bar/Pie Chart | One Categorical | Show frequencies/proportions/percentages | Class percentages |
| Stacked/Multiple Bar | Two+ Categorical | Compares proportions within groups | Percentages within groups | 
| Historgram | One scale | Shows distribution of results | Mean and Standard Deviation | 
| Scatter Plot | Two Scale | Relationship between two variables and helps detect outliers | Correlation co-efficient | 
| Boxplot | One Scale/Categorical | Compares spread of values | Median and IQR | 
| Line Chart | Scale by time | Displays changes over time/comparison of groups | Means by time point | 
| Means Plot | Oe scale/2 Categorical | Looks at combined effect of two Categorical variables on the mean of one scale variable | Means |
#### Parametric vs Non-Parametric Tests
* Parametric
  * Mneumonic : IPOO (Independent, Paired, One-way, One-way Repeated)
  * Preferred as they're more powerful
    * More likely to detect a difference
  * Requires continuous or discrete values (scale values)
  * Assumes a normal distribution with no outliers
  * Sample size has to be larger
  * Types
    * Independent-Samples T Tests
      * Example: Chemically-treated algae vs non-chemically-treated
    * Paired-Samples T Tests
      * Example: Before and After Tests
        * Crab Eyepatch Test
    * One-way ANOVA
* Non-Parametric
  * Mneumonic: Mann Will Krush Fries
  * Fallback tests due to skewed data
  * Types
    * Mann-Whitney Test
      * Two samples have the same shape (but still skewed)
    * Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
      * Symmetric distribution - one is left- and the other is right-skewed
    * Kruskal-Wallis Test
      * Same shape and variances
  * Usually based on ranks or signs
* Corresponding Tests
  * T Tests -> Mann-Whitney
  * Paired-Samples T Test -> Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test
  * One-way ANOVA -> Kruskal-Wallis Test
  * One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA -> Friedman's ANOVA
#### Confidence Intervals
* Most research uses sample data to make inferences about a larger population
* Each CI has a matching constant value to work with.
  * For 95%, it's 1.96
* So to calculate an interval range for any given sample mean at 95%, you'd do:
  * X Â± 1.96 * (s / sqrt(n))
    * X = sample mean
    * s = standard deviation
    * n = number in sample
    * (s / sqrt(n)) = standard error
#### Hypothesis Testing
* **Null Hypothesis** - Typically states that there is no difference between groups or association between variables
  * Goal is to prove this wrong (reject it)
* **Alternative Hypothesis** - Often the research question
* **Significance Level** - Probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true
  * AKA - Type I error
  * p = 0.05 means there is a *1 in 20 chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true*
* **Test Statistic** - Value calculated from sample to decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis
* **P-value** - probability that the test statistic is true under the null hypothesis
  * You want to keep this as low as possible, usually 0.05
* Court Case analogy
  * Null hypothesis is the defendant is innocent
  * Alternative hypothesis is the defendant is guilty
  * Alternative hypothesis is true if there is a less then 5% (p < 0.05) that the defendant is innocent
## Sample Size and Hypothesis Tests
* Larger the sample size, the more likely of a significant result (p < 0.05)
* **Effect Size** - Measure of strength or magnitude
  * (mean of experimental group - mean of control group) / standard deviation
  * 0.2-0.3 is "small", ~0.5 is "medium" and > 0.8 is "large"
* Partial eta-squared
  * Measure of variance
  * 0.01 is a small association, 0.05 is medium, and 0.1 is large
