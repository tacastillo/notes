## Objectives
* What are the primary info reqs of HCOs
* What are the clinical, financial and admin functions provided by health care information systems; and what are the benefits?
* How have changes in HC delivery models changed the scope of HCISs?
* How do differences among business strategies and org structs influence info systems' choices?
* How are ongoing HC reforms, tech advances, and changing social norms likely to affect HCISs?
## 14.1 Introduction
* **HCO (Health Care Organizations)** - business entities that deliver clinical care
  * like health systems
* Various stakeholders in an HCO
  * Clinicians, admins, governing boards
* **HCIS (Health Care Information System)** - tooling to support access and maangement that HCPs need
  * clinical, claims, operational data, etc.
* **ACO (Accountable Care Organization)** - something something, about linking quality with cost, etc... I spent 5 minutes trying to find a non-circumnavigate-y definition, but failed
### 14.1.1 Evolution from Automation of Specific Functions Health Care System Information Systems
* **IDN (Integrated Delivery Networks)** - consolidating providers into one system
  * very strong at the regional level in the 90s
* Started off at department-level HISs
* Ambulatory Medical Record Systems - for large outpatient clinics
* Practice Management Systems - for private practice physicians
* But good luck with data interop
  * a 2-way interface is... don't forget, a 2-way street
    * it's 2 transforms, not 1; never forget
* **Interface Engine** - an intermediary service that other HISs translated into, and the engine needed to know how to translate out the HIS' proprietary data model
* Many IDNs were either swallowed up by large national health systems, or joined up with an HMO (payer)
* Hospitals make a lot of many because it's few patients, but the treatments are expensive (inpatients)
  * Business models that work in hospitals don't necessarily work in outpatient clinics
    * High throughput of patients, low cost treatments
### 14.1.2 Information Requirements
* For clinicians:
  * present patient-specific data to care givers for interpretation
  * communicate with other HCPs
* For admins:
  * daily operation and management
  * bills, employee/vendor payments, supplies
* Operational Info Needs
  * Operational requirements
    * where is the patient? what drugs are they taking? who is their payer?
    * what patients need a reminder for their appointment?
  * Planning requirements
    * What are the clinical guidelines? What have similar patients done? 
  * Documentation and reporting requirements
    * record maintenance for internal and external reporting
    * ex. vaccination, STD reporting, creditation/accreditation, Medicare/Medicaid
### 14.1.3 Integration Requirements
* Availability/uptime, integrated view, consistent data; secure
#### 14.1.3.1 Data Integration
* Inpatient data is typically much more detailed than outpatient
  * some places are happy with just outpatient claims data
    * especially ambulatory-care clinics and private practices
* Inconsistencies can happen during hand-off
#### 14.1.3.2 Process Integration
* How do we combine data longitudinally and have access to the whole narrative?
* Case managers for patients were not a huge thing until recently
* HCISs are only worth it if they the infrastructure and use cases are planned out and existent
  * Cost/benefit analysis
  * Don't do it for the sake of doing it
### 14.1.4 Security and Confidentiality Requirements
* ...HIPAA
* Most security breaches are due to human error, not computer error
### 14.1.5 Benefits of HCISs
* HCPs spend about 3/4s of their time handling information
* Cost Reduction (due to efficiency)
* Productivity Enhancements
  * the initial producitivity after adoption drops though because of the learning curve
* Quality and Service Improvement
  * documentation completedness, reduction in drug errors, quicker response to adverse events, and inter-provider comms
* Competitive Advantage
* Regulatory Compliance
  * regulations via FDA, HIPAA, DoLabor, OSHA, EPA, etc.
### 14.1.6 Managing Info Systems in a Changing HC Env
* HCIS implementation often takes multiple years and 10s of millions of dollars
#### 14.1.6.1 Changing Technologies
#### 14.1.6.2 Changing Culture
* Value-based care and pay-for-performance
#### 14.1.6.3 Changing Processes
* LEAN or Six Sigma
* How interdisciplinary care works
#### 14.1.6.4 Management and Governance
* word soup
## 14.2 Functions and Components of an HCIS
### 14.2.1 Patient Management and Billing
* hospital census and patient billing were the first to get automated
* ***E*MPI (*Enterprise* Master Patient Index)** - used to map patient data within/across an institution
* **ADT (Admission-Discharge-Transfer)** - model to track inpatient patient status
  * also, all events you can bind CDS alerts to
    * or housekeeping alerts at hand-off
* **Patient-tracking application** - software used to monitor where a patient is
  * ie. how long in the ED waiting, then in triage, then actually seen
### 14.2.2 Ancillary Services
* support the clinical departments
* labs, pharma, diagnostics, radiology, blood-bank, ORs, medical records, etc.
* lots of these verticals can be automated
### 14.2.3 Care Delivery and Clinical Documentation
* automated *CPOE* and *results reporting*
* **Clinical Pathways** - time-based heuristics for clinical goals, treatments, and expected outcomes
* **Closed Loop Medication Management Systems** - tracking e2e the ordering, dispensing, and administering of drugs to a patient
### 14.2.4 Clinical Decision Support
* Examples
  * alerts on patient food or drug allergies
  * calculators for drug dosages
  * recommended antiobiotics before a surgery
  * prompting/discontinuation of drug refills
  * **Clinical-event monitors** watch for adverse events
  * Reminders for preventive services like mammograms, vaccinations, etc. 
### 14.2.5 Financial and Resource Management
* ofc this stuff is the first to get adopted electronically
* **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)** - standardized payment transfers between payer and providers
* Types of payments: **capitated, bundled, diagnosis-based, per diem**
* **Contract-Management Systems** - tools to estimate cost of care and compare to actual stats
* **Patient Triage** - direct patients to the appropriate health services
## Historical Evolution of the Tech in HCISs
### 14.3.1 Central and Mainframe-based Systems
* Okay, this chapter *also* mentions the L-Martin El Camino Hospital EHR
  * I'm officially calling it: an EHR is a type of HCIS
* ...single computer on-prem systems
### 14.3.2 Departmental Systems
* dedicated per dept
### 14.3.3 Integrated Systems from Single Vendors
* "best-of-breed" - ok, capitalism
## 14.4 Architecture
* 3 layers: data, business logic, and user-interface
## 14.5 Forces That WIll Change the Future of HCISs
* HITECH Act, ARRA Act
### 14.5.1 Changing Organizational Landscape
* 3-4% of total revenue in HC is spent in tech operating budgets
  * Most industries spend 3-4 times *that*
### 14.5.2 Tech Changes
* Yeah, really can't trust this guy; homeboy just said XML is the future ðŸ™ƒ
* speech-to-text, NLP, multimodality, etc.
* Interop - patients see multiple physicians, and a PCP, and potentially across multiple HCOs or IDNs
### 14.5.3 Societal Changes
* Preventative care is more popular
* ....did USB sticks really just get highlighted as a vocab word? Thank god this chapter is done.
