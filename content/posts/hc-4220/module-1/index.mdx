# Data Mining Module 1
## Book - Introduction to Data Mining (Tan)
### Introduction
* Various different industries have started to produce various types of data. With this data, they have started to find information, knowledge and wisdom from it.
* Each of these industries have their own data issues though.
### 1.1 What is Data Mining?
* Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information in large data repositories
* Data mining can be used for purposes such as finding patterns or predicting outcomes
* Information retrieval is not data mining
    * Data mining has been used to improve information retrieval
#### Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
* KDD stands for Knowledge Discovery in Databases
* the five segments of KDD according to this book are:
    * Input data, data pre-processing, data mining, post-processing and constructing information
* Pre-processing is transforming the raw input data into an appropriate format for analysis
* "Closing the loop" is integrating data mining results into decision support systems
### 1.2 Motivating Challenges
* Scalability
    * Data sets to the size of petabytes are being used
    * Different algorithms and data structures must be considered for data at scale
    * Out-of-core algorithms are algorithms that that don't load all the data into memory
    * Can also use sampling or distributed algorithms
* High Dimensionality
    * records can have hundreds of thousands of columns/features
* Heterogenous and Complex Data
    * There are complex data types arising like JSON, hyperlinks, text, DNA, time series data, etc.
* Data Ownership and Distribution
    * Data needed may not be stored in one location or owned by one organization
    * Distributed data mining algorithms must figure out:
        * how to reduce the amount of pings to the data
        * how to consolidate the data transfer
        * how to deal with data security
* Non-Traditional Analysis
    * Traditional analysis is the hypothesis-and-test paradigm
    * New data tasks require evaluating up to thousands of hypotheses at a time
### 1.3 The Origins of Data Mining
* Adopts from statistics: sampling, estimate and hypothesis testing
* Adopts from computer science: search algorithms and modeling techniques
* Also adopts knowledge from database systems and parallel computing
### 1.4 Data Mining Tasks
* Predictive Tasks - predict the value of a target given the values of the predictors
    * Classifications and regression tasks
* Descriptive Tasks - Derive patterns, correlations, trends, clusters, trajectories and anomalies
    * Associating analysis is used to discover patterns that describe strongly associated features in the data
        * For example, the iris data set
    * Cluster analysis seeks to find groups of closely related records.
    * Anomaly detection is the task of identifying records whose features are significantly different from the rest of the data 
## Data Mining in Healthcare - A Review

# KDD Process in Data Mining Video
* Data Cleaning - removing noise and inconsistent data
* Data Integration - combining multiple data sources
* Data Selection - retrieving data relevant to the analysis task
* Data Transformation - summary or aggregate operations are performed to consolidate the data in exactly what you need
* Data Mining - use intelligent methods (like machine learning) to extract data patterns
* Pattern Evaluation - review and analyze the patterns that are formed
* Knowledge Presentation - disseminate your findings
# CMS Value-Based Programs
## Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program
* awards acute care hospitals with incentive payments for inpatient quality of care
* uses the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) to find out how much to pay out
* both goals are for hospital patients (better QoC and better experience)
* Goals
    * reducing adverse events
    * adopting evidence-based care standards
    * develop processes that improve patient experience
    * increasing transparency
    * recognizing hospitals that provide high-quality care at a lower cost to Medicare
## Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)
* Hospitals get their Medicare reimbursements reduced by up to 3% if they're worse than other comparable hospitals at readmissions for a subset of conditions
## Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAP) Program
* promotes reductions in sepsis, pressure sores, and hip fractures
* the worst performing quartile has reimbursements reduced by 1%
## Other Value-Based Programs by CMS
* End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program (ESRD QIP)
    * up to 2% reduction in facilities that do not reach satisfactory levels in:
        * clinical care, care coordination, safety, and patient and family engagement
* Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF VBP)
    * incentive payments for reducing readmissions in skilled nursing facilities
* Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model
    * based on quality of care, and not just quantity of services provided
# Data Mining in Healthcare and Biomedicine: A Survey of the Literature
## Introduction to Data Mining
### What is Data Mining?
* Data mining began as as statistics and machine learning, but has expanded to pattern recognition, database design, AI, and visualization.
* Goal is to gain novel and deep insights in large data sets
* Data mining process consists of six steps
    * Business understanding, data understanding, data preparation, modeling, evaluation and deployment
    * or data selection, data preprocessing, data transformation, data mining, and interpretation/evaluation
* Data mining is often interpreted as a part of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD)
* Can be used for clinical decision-making or for administrative purposes
    * Clinical decisions: process of diagnosis, choice of treatment options, prognosis prediction
    * Administrative purposes: staffing estimates, insurance, demographic and market trends, quality assurance, process efficiency
### How is Data Mining Different From Statistics?
* Statistics is primary data analysis, data mining is secondary data analysis
* Statistics is rooted in math and being formulaic, data mining is ad hoc and rooted in heuristics
* Statistics uses samples, data mining uses populations
* Statistics uses numbers, data mining can use any medium of data (sounds, text, images)
* Statistics uses a hypothesis, data mining is inductive and tries to generalize from specific data
### How does data mining in biomedical and healthcare applications differ from other applications?
* Lots of privacy and legal issues
* Lots of missing values
    * Patients with the same diseases don't undergo the same labs or examinations
* Lots of time-related data
    * The order in which observations were taken matters
* Difficult to get data out of EMRs
* Data quality may be impacted by HIPAA and the deidentification process
* Legal considerations
    * data mining may find faults in data that may lead to malpractice suits
## Data Mining Algorithms
* Descriptive (unsupervised) and Predictive (supervised)
### Classification
* Can be rule-based (if-thens) or math-based (SVMs)
* A rule being 90-95% accurate is regarded as good
#### Naive Bayesian Classifier
* It's fast and easy to use because it just multiplies probabilities
* Assumes all attributes are independent of each other
* many patient symptoms and conditions are related to each other
    * like blood pressure and BMI
* Often used as a baseline algorithm
#### Neural Network
* Neural networks require many parameters
* Widely used for diagnosing diseases because it handles noisy data well
* Much slower than other methods
    * You gotta do GridSearch, too, to find the right parameters and that makes it take even longer
* Opaque models
    * Medical professionals often can't use them because they can't explain what happens inside
#### Decision Tree
* The root node is always the most significant attribute in the class
* Trees might get too complex to be traversable
* Pruning prevents overfitting by removing the least important branches from the bottom-up
#### Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
* Uses gradient descent to construct hyperplanes
* Most accurate, but requires a lot of computational resources
* Only can handle binary classifications, has to break down multiclass problems into multiple binary problems
#### Classification Based on Association (CBA)
* Don't know what this is
* Difficult to train because you need to tune the parameters to the exact value
#### Ensemble
* Three different kinds: boosting, bagging, and random subspace
#### AdaBoost
* Outperforms SVMs
### Clustering
* Exploratory in nature
* Uses only independent variables
#### Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms
* Large time complexity
* Can produce dendrograms which make them super explainable
* Single-link and average-link algorithms exist
#### Partitional Clustering Algorithms
* Like K-Means or KNN
* more accurate and more scalable than clustering algorithms
### Association
* Algorithms can be used to make associations
* If someone buys bread and butter, they're also likely to buy milk
* In healthcare, helps arise patterns among symptoms, health conditions and diseases
* Takes two percentages: support and confidence
* If an item is not frequent (not satisifying the support), then its descendants are also not frequent
## Guidelines on How to Use Data Mining Algorithms
### Classification Guidelines
* Remove redundant (Age and DOB) or irrelevant (Sex on prostate cancer) features
* Combinations can happen, so be careful when performing noise reduction
* Use cross-validation
### Clustering Guidelines
* Use hierarchical clustering first to get an idea of K, and then use K-Means
    * probably use average-link
* Remove outliers because K-means is sensitive to them
* Don't forget to OneHot or OrdinalEncode your values
### Association Guidelines
* Gotta create a concept hierarchy (like in OMOP)
    * Because it's not just bread, it's sourdough, or white, or Killer Dave's
## Data Mining Applications in Industry
### Highmark: Healthcare Fraud Prevention
* Built classification models to predict fraudulent insurance claims
### Highmark: Detecting Underdiagnosed Patients
* Made a decision tree risk classifier for 13 conditions
* Alerted those patients for early screening
### Healthways: Reducing Increase Healthcare Costs
* identifies high-risk customer
## Data Mining in Research AReas
### Classification Applications
* Always important to try multiple algorithms
* lol, used the Wisconsin breast cancer data set
### Clustering Applications
* able to cluster good and poor prognosis tumors
### Association Applications
* identify relationships between a specific drug and other drugs
## Conclusion
* Several problems that hamper its clinical usage
* data mining algoirthms usually require hyperparameters
* data mining accuracy is usually not high enough to be used in a clinical setting
    * generally low quality of patient data
* lack of full data mining packages for KDD
# Using Data Mining Strategies in Clinical Decision-Making
## Decision Making
* Two types of decision-making
    * Analytics and logical
    * Interpretice and intuitive
* Social judgement theory
* Intuition is an important part of clinical decision making
## Data Mining
* Data mining is understanding and interpreting the data by computational techniques from statistics, machine learning and pattern recognition in order to predict other variables or identify relationships within the information
* Used as far back as 1970 to diagnose renal disease
* Data mining is used to *minimize* errors in decision making
## Methods
* 21 articles
* Decision trees are pretty popular
* Rotator cuff tear example
    * high false positive rate manually done
    * Neural networks were used on variables such as pain and demographics
* Data mining saves time
* Limitations
    * Large amounts of data are required
    * Usually blackboxes
