# Data Mining Module 1
## Book - Introduction to Data Mining (Tan)
### Introduction
* Various different industries have started to produce various types of data. With this data, they have started to find information, knowledge and wisdom from it.
* Each of these industries have their own data issues though.
### 1.1 What is Data Mining?
* Data mining is the process of automatically discovering useful information in large data repositories
* Data mining can be used for purposes such as finding patterns or predicting outcomes
* Information retrieval is not data mining
    * Data mining has been used to improve information retrieval
#### Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery
* KDD stands for Knowledge Discovery in Databases
* the five segments of KDD according to this book are:
    * Input data, data pre-processing, data mining, post-processing and constructing information
* Pre-processing is transforming the raw input data into an appropriate format for analysis
* "Closing the loop" is integrating data mining results into decision support systems
### 1.2 Motivating Challenges
* Scalability
    * Data sets to the size of petabytes are being used
    * Different algorithms and data structures must be considered for data at scale
    * Out-of-core algorithms are algorithms that that don't load all the data into memory
    * Can also use sampling or distributed algorithms
* High Dimensionality
    * records can have hundreds of thousands of columns/features
* Heterogenous and Complex Data
    * There are complex data types arising like JSON, hyperlinks, text, DNA, time series data, etc.
* Data Ownership and Distribution
    * Data needed may not be stored in one location or owned by one organization
    * Distributed data mining algorithms must figure out:
        * how to reduce the amount of pings to the data
        * how to consolidate the data transfer
        * how to deal with data security
* Non-Traditional Analysis
    * Traditional analysis is the hypothesis-and-test paradigm
    * New data tasks require evaluating up to thousands of hypotheses at a time
### 1.3 The Origins of Data Mining
* Adopts from statistics: sampling, estimate and hypothesis testing
* Adopts from computer science: search algorithms and modeling techniques
* Also adopts knowledge from database systems and parallel computing
### 1.4 Data Mining Tasks
* Predictive Tasks - predict the value of a target given the values of the predictors
    * Classifications and regression tasks
* Descriptive Tasks - Derive patterns, correlations, trends, clusters, trajectories and anomalies
    * Associating analysis is used to discover patterns that describe strongly associated features in the data
        * For example, the iris data set
    * Cluster analysis seeks to find groups of closely related records.
    * Anomaly detection is the task of identifying records whose features are significantly different from the rest of the data 
## Data Mining in Healthcare - A Review
### Abstract
* Data mining is the process of pattern discovery and extraction where huge amount of data is involved.
### Introduction
* Data mining methods include generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization and meta-rule guided mining
* 50 articles used in this systemic review
### 2. Data Mining An Overview
* Data mining is the process of applying computer based information systems for discovering knowledge from data
#### 2.1 Disciplines Involved in Data Mining
* machine learning, artificial intelligence, probability, and statistics
* research was predominantly in the machine learning space (40 articles out of 50)
#### 2.2 Data Mining Models
* Predictive models
    * often apply supervised learning to predict unknown or future values
    * most commonly used in healthcare (47 out of 50)
* Descriptive models
    * often apply unsupervised learning in finding patterns describing the data that can be interpreted by humans
#### 2.3 Data Mining Tasks
* Classification, association rules, clustering, anomaly detection
    * predominantly classification (42 out of 50)
### 2.4 Data Mining Methods
* Anomaly detection uses standard support vector descriptions, density induced SVDs, and Gaussian mixture. 
* For classification: discriminant analysis, decision tree, Markov chains, swarm intelligence, KNN, genetic classifiers, neural networks, SVMs and association rules
### 3. Data Mining in Healthcare
* Lots of rich data, courtesy of EMRs and administrative data
* Mainly being used to predict various diseases and diagnosing for clinicians
#### 3.1 Anomaly Detection
* can be used to classify whether or not a patient has a condition/disorder
#### 3.2 Clustering
* Can be used to predict readmissions
#### 3.3.1 Statistical Classification
* class imbalance problems are prevalent in healthcare data sets
* Mahalanobis Taguchi System (MTS) algorithm is useful with unbalanced data
#### 3.3.2 Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
* Useful if the data is in linear form
#### 3.3.3 Decision Tree
* performs poorly on imbalanced data sets
#### 3.3.4 Swarm Intelligence
* Particle swarm optimization (PSO) efficiently finds optimal/near optimal solutions in large search spaces.
#### 3.3.5 K-Nearest Neighbor
* Large focus on accuracy rather than classification time
#### 3.3.6 Logistic Regression
* Logistic regressions work well for larger data sets
#### 3.3.7 Bayesian Classifier
* handles missing data well
#### 3.3.8 Support Vector Machines
* great at generalization/doesn't overfit often
### Discussion
* Common to find imbalanced data sets
* Lots of missing values too
# KDD Process in Data Mining Video
* Data Cleaning - removing noise and inconsistent data
* Data Integration - combining multiple data sources
* Data Selection - retrieving data relevant to the analysis task
* Data Transformation - summary or aggregate operations are performed to consolidate the data in exactly what you need
* Data Mining - use intelligent methods (like machine learning) to extract data patterns
* Pattern Evaluation - review and analyze the patterns that are formed
* Knowledge Presentation - disseminate your findings
# CMS Value-Based Programs
## Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program
* awards acute care hospitals with incentive payments for inpatient quality of care
* uses the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) to find out how much to pay out
* both goals are for hospital patients (better QoC and better experience)
* Goals
    * reducing adverse events
    * adopting evidence-based care standards
    * develop processes that improve patient experience
    * increasing transparency
    * recognizing hospitals that provide high-quality care at a lower cost to Medicare
## Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP)
* Hospitals get their Medicare reimbursements reduced by up to 3% if they're worse than other comparable hospitals at readmissions for a subset of conditions
## Hospital-Acquired Conditions (HAP) Program
* promotes reductions in sepsis, pressure sores, and hip fractures
* the worst performing quartile has reimbursements reduced by 1%
## Other Value-Based Programs by CMS
* End-Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program (ESRD QIP)
    * up to 2% reduction in facilities that do not reach satisfactory levels in:
        * clinical care, care coordination, safety, and patient and family engagement
* Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (SNF VBP)
    * incentive payments for reducing readmissions in skilled nursing facilities
* Home Health Value-Based Purchasing (HHVBP) Model
    * based on quality of care, and not just quantity of services provided
