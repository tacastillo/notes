    * bring happiness to patients and providers
    * improve human interaction
      * being a witness to their recovery+suffering, rather than an actor

      * makes it fun and easy to use
      * how do we create a feedback loop for behavior change?
  * **timely** access to care
    * windows of opportunity for finding help are *small* (hours)
      * if a patient cannot immediately find care, it's not going to happen
        * follow metaphor, we don't have enough **doors**
  * we live in an addictive world (**dopamine economy**)
    * everything is driven by some type of addiction 
      * those trying to recover from addictions are swimming upstream when the world is trying to get you addicted to things
        * not just conventional addictions, we're talking social addictions, technology, etc.

  * providers don't want to prescribe MAT
    * providers are worried that their practices will be overrun by those with SUDs
      * "what type of people" - providers :roll-eyes:
    * recovery is not just MAT, it's a system of care that involves multiple treatments at once
      * therapy, support groups, treatment, drugs, 12-step meetings, yoga
      * **THE LAST DAY JUST GOT PLUGGED** - the best fucking podcast out there right now, i recommend it to **everyone**
* Danielle Schlosser - Senior Clinical Scientist - Verily

## Advancing Equity in Digital Health
* Lauren Dugard Thomas - Principal, Innovation, Blue Shield California - Haas MBA/MPH
  * Experienced questions and misunderstanding of care at church + family
  * opportunities aren't commonly seen because those effective are not part of the teams
  * **lens of equity** - perspective from different types of patients, of different walks of life
    * decisionmakers *and* human interaction (patient-provider)
  * you are not your user
    * ex. "We're building it out for hispanics"
      * Latinx? Spanish-speaking? Culturally competent?
    * have people who will truly understand what you're doing be in the room
  * the obligation goes to the payer when building out solutions
    * ie. if a Medicaid program pays a software firm to build an app, the program is responsible of checking the lens of the software firm
* Melissa Lim - CMO, Somnology, Inc.
  * improve sleep, using an IoT platform
  * not that hard to start with Medicaid
  * Myth: "Medicaid patients are not involved with their own health"
    * no show rates - 25%
      * some clinics are double-triple booking
    * not obstacles, but opportunities for growth
      * texting, calling, email, other comms, telehealth
  * bias folks have: low-income === low intelligence
    * "why bother nihilism"
    * solutions made do not factor in the patients that are affected by these conditions
  * *Start low-tech and build out*
    * understand the human workflow before you actually write anything
  * sleep study reimbursements tanked
    * Health Plan of San Mateo (Medicaid) created a bundled payment model for this
      * funds the study, and then allows the patients to also get CPAP machines and treatment
  * we are opaque with payer data
    * payers are typically the one with continuity of care data
      * oh, but the average tenure in a job is 3 years, and thus so is employee insurance :upside-down-smile:
  * "electronic kudos" only take you so far
    * human intervention (a personal email/message, etc.) is proven to improve clinical outcomes
* Michael Penn - Founder/Director, Health Equity Ventures
  * grew up with a very race-concious mindset
  * why people start companies -> addressing a need of a marketplace, solving a pain point 
  * healthcare has so much opportunity
    * Medicaid increases it by 10 to 100fold
  * **humanize this shit**
    * don't technologize things just because you can
    * human-centric :clap:
    * [Rubicon MD](https://www.rubiconmd.com/)
  * You want to find a [blue ocean](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Uncontested-Competition/dp/1591396190) opportunity space

## Big Data: Hope or Hype
### Making Healthier Choice the EAsier Choice
* Ricky Y. Choice, MD, MPH
  * Global Medical Director, Samsung Electronics
  * Practicing clinician in healthcare
* providers are blaming the patients for their own health outcomes
* Samsung Health Vision - Improving health outcomes through innovation and engaging consumer technology
  * people look at their phones 150 times a day, and make ~200 health-related decisions a day
* They had great outcomes
### Jailbreaking Health Data
* Claudia Williams - Manifest Medex
* Three takeaways
  * Data silos are th ebiggest block to technological advances in HC
  * massive policy push is underway to address this (primarily from the gov level)
  * data utilities (such as Manifest Medex) can help
* everyone hoards data for the value of their own economic benefit
* HHS Proposed Re-evaluations
  * Health plans must give patietns access to claism records through APIs
  * Sharing data is a condition of participation in Medicare
  * Strong penalites for providers and hospitals if they block the flow of data
  * shares clinical AND claims  ata for 20m+ patients
  * used as a backbone for providers to ask questions
    * what is my patient facing?
  * Democratizing for providers and patients
### Big Data on the Front Lines of Healthcare
* Usha Periyanayagam, MD, MPH, Emergency Medicine doctor, Komodo Health
* Data is siloed, framented, biased and outdated/stagnant
* bad data is like cracks in a foundation
* Komodo Health is built by connecting patient data across all categories and locations in the health system
  * de-identifies and links patient data for 320m patients to create a full portrait of continuity of care
* Understand where patients are **and how they get there**
  * Referral networks!!!
* Clinical trials are difficult in diseases that are overrepresented in minorities
### Panel Portion
* how do you deliver a slice of information when needed?
  * medical directors are absolutely overhwlemed with data
* patients own their data
* Open Notes - idea that patients should be allowed to look at their own clinical notes
* wow i wish i didn't get stuck replying to slack messages for a bit because I feel like i missed most of the actual panel
* Adherence
  * delivering insights that are actually *meaningful*
    * needs to be proactive
      * can't just be told you got 6 hours of sleep
      * gotta give activities and suggestions and **actions** using the data
## Framing the Future of Health
* Daniel Kraft, MD, Exponential Medicine
* we're in a 4th industrial revolution... except in healthcare 
* It's not about an individual revolution, but rather how we stack and combine different evolutions and changes over time
  * genomics, imagin, telemedicine, robots, etc.
  * **connect the dots**
* Data is exponential, information to a lesser degree, and to a much lesser degree, clinical utility
* "Outcomes are the new incomes"
* I'm just going to stop taking notes because this guy talks really fast, has really cool slides, and I can't multi-manage all these at once.
