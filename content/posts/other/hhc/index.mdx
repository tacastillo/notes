      * makes it fun and easy to use
      * how do we create a feedback loop for behavior change?
  * **timely** access to care
    * windows of opportunity for finding help are *small* (hours)
      * if a patient cannot immediately find care, it's not going to happen
        * follow metaphor, we don't have enough **doors**
  * we live in an addictive world (**dopamine economy**)
    * everything is driven by some type of addiction 
      * those trying to recover from addictions are swimming upstream when the world is trying to get you addicted to things
        * not just conventional addictions, we're talking social addictions, technology, etc.
* Daniela Luzi Tudor - CEO - Weconnect Health Management
  * chronic disease <-> mental disorder
  * confided in doctor about addiction, but was brushed off and continued for a decade
  * when she went into inpatient settings, her former employer kept her on insurance

  * on discharge, she was just given a list of things to keep in mind
  * Weconnect - evidence-based app and community that rewards towards social determinant based information
  * attributes a lot towards privilege and luck
    * how can we help those that don't have the opportunities/luck she had
  * on day of discharge, went to starbucks, couldn't pay, confessed about rehab, got a drink and cupcake
    * that compassion and empathy from the barista helped start it all
    * **contingency management** - incentives for improving outcomes
      * data-driven and counselor-driven
  * FQHC - federally qualified health center
  * most mHealth consumer-facing apps are difficult and boring to use
    * fun ones are used more often, making it personal
    * *technology can never replace the human connection*
  * providers don't want to prescribe MAT
    * providers are worried that their practices will be overrun by those with SUDs
      * "what type of people" - providers :roll-eyes:
    * recovery is not just MAT, it's a system of care that involves multiple treatments at once
      * therapy, support groups, treatment, drugs, 12-step meetings, yoga
      * **THE LAST DAY JUST GOT PLUGGED** - the best fucking podcast out there right now, i recommend it to **everyone**
* Danielle Schlosser - Senior Clinical Scientist - Verily
  * 9 out of 10 people with a SUD aren't in treatment
    * and how many in those 9 try to find treatment and find the wrong *doors*
    * data shows you the pathways and routes
      * where to put the right doors
    * holy shit, this is *gold*
  * Imagine if we could find every Daniela, unpack the variables, and find the ways to improve them
    * quantify the likelihood of recovery, and how to improve this likelihood
    * data helps you navigate and provide guiderails
