* CT - Radiation - difficult to use, but super high-resolution
* MRI - Magnets - flexible, but expensive
  * different levels of granularity and details, of soft tissue/liquids
  * can't see bones
  * fMRIs - functional MRIs
* Ultrasound - cheap and light
* PET - Inject radioactive material - trace material in the body
  * PET vs PET TrueX
    * Two different signals being read
      * PET ignores bones by comparing to the CT, PET True is the raw with bones
* Details
  * Come in parallel slides
  * detail isn't all that great.
  * 512x512 vs the 1000s in pathology pyramid structure
* Completely different from pathology
* Can be a single 2-D array, or a intersecting 2-D arrays
  * or even adding a 3rd intersection of a 2-D array (**Time!**)
* Important to be able to combine and look at a variety of different types of imaging at once/comparison
* *Acquisition* - the act of conducting a scan/image
* PET/CT
  * Does a PET/CT sequentially in one session
* DICOM
  * national standard, forced by the government
    * and thus heavily adopted internationally
  * Metadata can give you a lot of info about the file
  * granularity (pixel spacing/size of a pixel)
    * On OsiriX, metadata tag is in the top right corner of an open slide
* Fun fact on anonymization
  * you often have to cut out the groin... because you can tell gender from that
* You can make 3-D reconstructions using AI!
  * Make histograms of each slide and piece those together
* brightness
  * calculate the min/max brightness in the images, and maps those to a look up table
  * look up table can be used a color scale
    * color matters for different purposes
      * ie. PET is pretty much only done with "hot metal" scale
