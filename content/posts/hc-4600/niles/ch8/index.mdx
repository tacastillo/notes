## Learning Objectives
* Discuss different cost-sharing strategies in health insurance plans
* Analyze differe types of consumer-driven health plans
* Identify the different gov and private health insurance reimbursement methods

## Introduction
* In 2014, US spent $2.5T in health care, aka 17.5% of GDP
* Expected to be 20% by 2024
* Three reasons for increases:
  * inflation, and health care just naturally increases faster than inflation
  * life expectancy increases, and so more people need more care
    * plus increase in chronic conditions
  * technology gets more complex; complex means more money gets spent
* breakdown of how insurance pays for stuff
  * out-of-pocket plus cost sharing
  * health insurance plans, such as indemnity or MCOs (managed care orgs)
  * public of gov funding such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other gov programs
* most insurance is provided privately via employers
* COBRA - Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Program 
  * insurance while you're unemployed
## Healthcare Spending by Service Type
### Hospital and Clinical Services
* Spending increased by 4% in 2014, 3% in 2013
  * On average
  * Spending vs prices - two different things
### Home Health Chapter
* Increased by 4.8% in 2014, 3.35 in 2013
* Medicare/Medicaid makes up 77% of home health spending
  * typically elderly, disabilities, etc.
### Nursing Care and Continuing Care Retirement Community Spending
* 2014 - +3.6%, 2013 - +2.4%
### Prescription Drugs
* 2014 - +12%, 2010 - *0.4%* in 2010
### Healthcare Spending By Sources of Funds
* Medicare is increasing by 6% in 2014, comp. to 2013 of 3%
* Medicaid is 11% vs 6%
* Out-of-pocket payments grew, but at a lower rate
  * 1.3% in 2014, 2.1% in 2013
## Health Insurance as a Payer for Health Services
* 1847, Boston insurance company offered sickness insurance to consumers
* 19th cent, coal mining+railroad companies offered medical services with company doctors
* The AMA shot down universal healthcare, wow
* Blue Cross Blue Shield started off as a group of HS teachers in Houston paying $6/year for 21 insured days of hospital care
* Social Security Act of 1935
* Unpaid Leave means you still get health insurance, even if you're not working
## Types of Health Insurance
* Most common is private insurance via employers
* Voluntary health insurance (VHI) 
  * private insurance provided by (non/for)-profits such as BCBS
* Social insurance
  * Insurance at the federal, state or local level
  * Medicare
* Public welfare insurance
  * Medicaid
### Private Insurance
* Group insurance - split the risk(cost) across everyone
  * a dozen patients would justify the cost for a patient with multiple chronic conditions, keeping the cost low for the person who needs more health resources
  * so it's _cost sharing_ in the sense that the costs are shared _across_ many beneficiaries
* Individual insurance - all costs/benefits are assessed based on an individual's health
  * minimums, premiums, deductibles are all based on the individual
  * riskier for payers since there is more volatility and inaccuracy in trying to calculate all this
* Self-insurance - self-funded or organized by the companies themselves
  * Target is a huge name for this
* Managed care plans - health program that combines admin costs and service costs for cost control
  * honestly, still no clue what this means.
### Two Types of Payment
* Fee for service
  * Someone pays the provider for the care done at the time/after care
* Prepayment
  * Patient pays fied, predetermined amount for services
  * Managed Care Models do this!!!
## Cost Sharing of Health Services
* Co-payment - the payer and patient split parts of the cost
  * Coinsurance - the patient pays a percentage of the cost
* Deductible - an amount a patient has to pay first to use fee for service insurance
### Types of Health Insurance Policies
* Comprehensive - covers everything
* Major Medical Policies - covers surgeries and inpatient care
* Catastrophic - cover unusual illnesses with high deductibles and have lifetime caps
* Others 
  * cancer-specific
  * medigap, Medicare supplement, and medsup to add on to Medicare
## Types of Health Insurance Plans
* Indemnity - fee-for-service plans
  * Mostly reimbursement-based
* Managed Care Plans - HMOs, PPos and POS (point-of-service) plans
  * One Medical, Kaiser, etc.
### CDHPs - Consumer-driven Health Plans
* HRAs - began in 2001, bc of IRS
  * employee forfeits amount when they leave the company
* HSAs were made courtesy of of Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003
  * pairs great with deductibles
  * forced patients to be more cost conscious
* FSAs... are FSAs
  * MSAs - very similar to HSAs and FSAs
* self-funded insurances
  * companies will typically buy a "reinsurance" from an actual insurance company
    * to prevent catastrophic loss
### Long-Term Care Insurance
* Long-term care as in *nursing homes and assisted living facilities*
* Medicare doesn't cover it naturally (special programs)
* Hard to get approval with pre-existing conditions
* 6k/mo for a semi-private nursing home room, 4k for ALF
* Crisis - no one plans for this 
  * community networks of shared services (think shared nannies)
  * villages - network of homes with shared services; one annual membership fee, volunteer-run
## Public Financing of Healthcare Services
* entitlement program - people are _entitled_ to it because they pay for it over years before they get it
* Medicare eligibility
  * 65 <, disabled who receive SSI, or end-state renal disease (needs dialysis)
### Medicare
* in 2016, 57m Medicare beneficiaries
#### Medicare Part A: Hospital Insurance
* Inpatient care
* 1.45% per paycheck, matched by company, or 2.9% if individual employed
* inpatient care, home health
* facility care, nursing home and hospice care **must** be heavily justified
#### Medicare Part B: Voluntary Medical Insurance
* 1/4 is paid premiums (~$100/mo), 76% from treasury (aka taxes)
* outpatient care
* covers medically necessary services and supplies
* preventative services, too
  * no cost sharing, all covered for most of this stuff
* clinical research, ambulances, durable medical equipment, mental health, second opinions before surgery, limited outpatient Rx drugs
* only available if you sign up for Part A
#### Medicare Part C: Medicare Advantage
* Managed care roll up of both A and B
* Offered via other private insurance companies
  * Medicare pays a fixed amount to that company per beneficiary with Part C plan 
  * cost varies per company
#### Medicare Part D: Prescription **D** rugs
* part of MMA (medicare prescription drug improvement and moderanization act) of 2003
* funded by taxes
* voluntary
* Used to have a donut hole/coverage gap
  * Basically a delayed deductible
  * Everything is covered for a reasonable amount, then there's a gap where nothing is covered, then hits the "catastrophic" spot where everything is covered again
  * Slowly removed by ACA, officially gone as of 2020
    * Previously had a cost sharing initiative for what was in the gap in the meantime
#### Medigap or Medicare Supplement Plan or Medsup
* Medicare only covers less than half of spending of their recipients
* Typically padded by Medicare if eligible
* or employer-sponsored retirement insurance
* or other private insurance specialty plans, commonly referred to as **medigap**
## Medicare

* **Community First Choice** - optional Medicaid benefit, provides community health services to recipients with disabilities
  * focus on receiving care at home or at community clinics vs hospitals
* eligibility varies by state
* covers at least 40% of costs of provider services
### CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program)
* gave state $40b over a decade for HC for children
* additional funds to expand Medicaid for children under 19
  * targeted for families who are in the gap between Medicaid and private insurance
* federal matches 93% of money put in by states
### Program for All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly
* Otherwise known as PACE
* Focused on bringing community services to elderly to reduce the need for nursing homes
* belief that community can create better outcomes can nursing home care
### Worker's Compensation
* it's actually state-level, wow!
  * and legally enforced, not just something nice that gets added to your offer letter
* 66% of earning, tax-free
* rates vary by industry and rates of injury
* Often not utilized
  * estimates say tha tonly 1 out of 20 disease victims are followed through with
  * 1 out of 100 with occupational cancer
### Other Reimbursement Methods
#### TRICARE
* Insurance for military personnel
* Not the VA, but rather MHHS (Military Health Services System)
* HMO and PPO
#### Veteran's Health Administration
* The government has proven that the VA is providing insufficient care
* As of the writing of this book (2014? 2016?), the overhaul hasn't started yet
#### Indian Health Service
* Native americans and Alaskan Natives
* 15k employees for 556 recognized tribes
## Reimbursement Methods of Private Health Insurance Plans
* **UCR (usual, customary, and reasonable) services** - term used to describe the extent of services that private insurers want to cover
  * created by surveying providers at the community- and state-level
* whatever the difference is between what the provider charges and the payer has listed, the patient pays out of pocket for
* insurers are typically referred to as "third-party payers"
* **retrospective reimbursement** - the payer assesses how much they'll cover *after* the service is provided
  * as in they don't have any type of ledger pre-existing
* **prospective reimbursement** - not what ya think it is
  * the most common one
  * prospective in the sense that the payer already has a list of providers they have in network/contracts with
  * prospective in that the patient pays the payer upfront via premiums before any service is rendered
  * it's what most employer-provided health insurance is
* **capitated rate** - used to describe MCOs; set, fixed rate prices that payers give no matter what
* **per diem rates** - per patient per day, most common for hospitals/inpatient settings
* **cost-plus reimbursement** - per diem rates that uses total *operating costs and capital costs* to calculate day rate
## Governmental Reimbursement Methods for Healthcare Services
* DRGs, APGs, APCs, HHRGs, RUGs, RBRVs
* Certificates of need!
  * a hospital must justify that they are needed in an area before they can start up
* **cost shifting**- when providers try to stabilize their income by moving their prices
  * ie. if Medicaid/Medicare reimbursements prevent them from increasing prices, they increase prices for private insurances
### Hospital Reimbursement
* DRGs - diagnosis-related groups
* breaking things up based on condition
* **prospective payment system** - to establish reimbursement rates for certain conditions
* Incentivizes by letting providers keep the remainder from reimbursements, therefore want to keep stuff low
### Medicare Hospital Raadmission Reduction Program
* Getting readmitted is expensive for everyone
* ACA started this program; charged providers if they had readmissions
* Only 799 out of 3400+ hospitals didn't get charged
### Rsource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS)
* came as part of COBRA
* standard reimbursement method for Medicare Part B
* most common physician-fee schedule?
* broken up into: physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice insurance
* increased reimbursement by 15% in GP and family med
* providers who had signed a Medicare Participation Agreement
  * required accepting Medicare reimbursement as the full payment
  * prevented balance billing
* **balance billing**- a provider directly charging a patient (outside of copay) to offset the difference between Medicare payments and what the physician wants to charge
### Ambulatory Patient Groups (APGs) and Ambulatory Payment Categories (APCs)
* basically DRGs
### Resource Utilization Groups (RUG)
* type of DRG
* per diem rate that is impacted by how many resources a patient uses
### Home Health Resource Groups (HHRG)
* Medicare pays a flat amount for a 60-day period of care
  * it's the reason why you can have multiple admissions per stay
* It's a bundle payment system!!!
* has 80 different types of groups
* alternative to the traditional method: reward the quantity of care vs the quality of care/outcomes
### CMS Demonstration Models (aka Bundled Payments 101)
* Respective Acute Care Hospital Stay Only:
  * tbh idk, that's quite dense
* Respective Acute Care Hospital Stay Only plus Post-Acute Care
  * bundle includes inpatient stay plus 30, 60, or 90 days after care
  * 48 different conditions
* Retrospective Post-Acute Care Only
  * bundles for nursing facilities, inpatient rehab, long-term care, home health
* Acute Care Hospital Stay Only
  * Ooooh, this is the fun stuff
  * prosepectively-constructed
  * not actually done right now, but we want to
  * Connects to related readmissions within 30 days
  * flat bundled payment to the hospital
  * providers submit "no-pays" as just a heads up, and the hospital pays out the provider based on the bundled payment
### ACOs (Accountable Care Organizations)
* Medicare Shared Savings Program, Advance Payment ACO Model, Pioneer ACO Model
## Healthcare Financial Management
* priorities of hospitals
  * generating reasonable net income
  * setting prices for services
  * contracting management of third-party payers
  * analyzing data for cost control
  * ahdering to gov regulations such as reimbursement methods
  * minimizing financial risk
* There's a CFO who supervises: 
  * **comptroller** - the fellow who is in charge of account and reporting
  * also a treasurer - cash management, banking relations, accounts payable, etc.
  * and an internal auditor for regulation purposes
## Funds Disbursement
* called claims processing
* self-funded insurance programs typically have a third party admin/company do their claims for them
* Medicare/Medicaid has contracts with private insurers to do their claims for them
