## QALYs and DALYs
* Two ways to measure the burden of a disease
* **QALY (Quality-adjusted life years)** - focuses on the quality of the years, post-disease
    * Every year is given a status weight between 0 and 1, 0 is death, 1 is perfect health
    * Gives a raw score of the quality of the years
    * score divided by quality gives a percentage of average expected life quality
* **DALY (Disability-adjusted life years)** - focuses on how the disease's disabilities impact life
    * Takes standard life expectancy minus the age at expected death
    * also adds in the years survived with a disability
        * multiplying them by an established score/factor for the disability (ie. blindness is 0.33)
