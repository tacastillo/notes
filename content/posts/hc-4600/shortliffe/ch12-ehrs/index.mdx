## Objectives
* What is the definiton of an EHR?
* How does an EHR differ from a paper record?
* What are the *functional* components of an EHR?
* What are the benefits of an EHR?
* What are the impediments to development and use of an EHR?
## 12.1 What is an EHR?
* patient record, patient's chart, medical record, health recovrd - all synonymous
### 12.1.1 Purpose of a Patient Record
* Reiser says:
  * recall Obs., inform others, instruct students, gain knowledge, monitor perf,  justify intervention
* Anticipate it'll hold longitudinal, whole life data of a person
* VA ensures it'll preserve data for at least 75 years
* **Electronic Health Record System** - tools used to manage info, the whole shabang
  * alerts, reminders, linkages, analysis, etc.
  * organize, interpret, and react
### 12.1.2 Ways in Which EHRs Differ from Paper
* At a small-scale, data can be represented in customized ways
  *  ie. date formats
* can include multimedia such as scalable radiology imaging or ECG video loops
* call attention to dangerous trends or outliers
* paper can only be accessed at one place at a time
* easier to stay HIPAA compliant
* care at the VA after Hurricane Katrina was a great example of paper vs EHR
* more legible
* pries for more data with leading questions
  * ex. smoker? -> how many packs per day -> how soon after waking?
* data fields are also a pain point
  * many fields are required, but may not be available at the time
* Metrics that EHRs are measured by to assess benefit
  * Comprehensiveness of information
    * does it cover data from everywhere and all kinds?
    * outpatient? inpatient? PCP? specialists?
  * Duration of use and retention of data
  * degree of structure of data
  * Ubiquity of access
* **hot fail over** - failure at one node doesn't mean failure everywhere
  * CLOUD! AND! SCALING!
## 12.2 Historical Perspective
* There were more EHRs prior to Lockheed-Martin's in El Camino Hospital, but this was the big one that spread to 200 hospitals
* CDS, linkages, and suggestions were first done by HELP at LDS, Columbia, CCC at Beth Israel, Regenstrief at Wishard, etc.
* Ambulatory care EHR adoption was slower than inpatient adoption
  * we're talking like in the 80s
## 12.3 Functional Components of an EHR
* What is considered a functional component?
### 12.3.1 Integrated View of Patient Data
* covering everything would be great, but not possible
  * some patient data is not electronic yet (old charts)
  * data from clinics/radiology sites/etc  might not be linked back to a centralized EHR and just sit on their own
  * aaaand lack of interop
* another difficulty is the lack of MPI
* ontologies are still an issue, but LOINC, ICD-10, CPT are helping
* HL7 is mentioned
### 12.3.2 Clinician Order Entry
* Super important because a big problem was transcription/communication errors at hand-off/transfer
* CDS gives pop-ups about allergies or conflicts in Rx
* can be simple as "take pill @ 5mg 3x" or an entire suite/regime
### 12.3.3 Clinical Decision Support
* Reminders and alert improve care process!!!
  * but oh god, pls don't be Practice Fusion and suggest pain management the way they did
* Can be done as batch jobs, iterating through subsets of a cohort in the EHR
  * provides notifications, emails, etc. to provider or patient
  * provider: double check/follow through, etc.; patient: schedule appointment, do test, etc.
  * batch jobs are the best way for patients who don't regularly visit
    * in contrast to "on-open" mode; since their record is never open
* but most often delivered at the CPOE phase
  * keep forgetting - CPOE is **COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY**
  * useful because most alerts require an order to follow through
* can expedite an order with a single click
  * pre-populated forms based on patient record
  * oh god, opioids
  * best practice to annotate with rationale
* provide suggestions for once a lab is recorded or processed
  * or just alert a physician when it happens
* Reminders to outpatient settings quadrupled use of vaccines
* giving nurses alerts are useful for creating preventive measures
### 12.3.4 Access to Knowledge Sources
* an advanced/specialized CDS to provide linkages to NLIM PubMed/MedlinePlus and CDC info while documenting with a patient
  * buzzword is to "pull literature"
### 12.3.5 Integrated Communication and Reporting Support
* intra-EHR communication has been getting better
* untapped potential in communication between EHR and PHR
  * CGMonitors, home health data, consumer health data, etc.
* also improve patient hand-offs, aka. one clinician to another
* alert clinicians that Rx tests aren't being followed through with
* **(HIE) Health Integration Exchange** - groups of EHRs that share data and registries amongst each other
  * Indiana, Ontario, Kentucky, Memphis all have their own HIEs
* **eHealth Exchange** - formerly known as the HHS's NwHIN System
  * HUUUUGE HIE across the US
  * Read how many health systems are attached to it [here](https://ehealthexchange.org/participants/).
## 12.4 Fundamental Issues for Electronic Health Record Systems
* issues and alternatives related to data entry in EHRs
### 12.4.1 Data Capture
* Two ways to capture data:
  1. automated/electronically, ie. piping in straight form a lab machine and is automatically documented within the appropriate place in the EHR
  2. direct manual entry
#### 12.4.1.1 Electronic Interfaces
* preferred method is to connect an electronic interface like a machine to an EHR and pipe the data in automatically
* but bruh good luck tryna interface with *another* EHR **outside** of your own system through
  * like what happens when you go from a private practice peds to a PCP in a health system? nothing. that's what happens
#### 12.4.1.2 Manual Data Entry
* Combination of coding ontologies and free text
* Coding is great because it makes the data understandable by a machine
  * **selective retrieval** is a great word to describing the act of querying, aggregating, rolling up data, etc.
  * also allows for autocomplete
* Autocomplete or matching by producing a list of synonyms and showing confidence of matching is great
  * but actual NLP would be way better
#### 12.4.1.3 Physician-Entered Data
* Physicians are spending 20%+ of time documenting clinical encounters in an EHR
* Many clinicians believe that the people who Rx or create findings should be the one to document them
* A metric: the cost of an HCP's time
  * ie. a clinician's time is costly and wasted when documenting in an EHR, but not a scribe's 
* Dictation by transcription is a thing
  * but transcriptions are never completely accurate; someone still has to go over and validate it
    * more boring and possibly error-prone than just writing it from scratch
* so are scribes
* **Structured Encounter Forms** - templated paper forms that are easy to convert to structured EHR data
  * boxed numbers, checkboxes, circling, bar codes, etc.
* Manual entry may taking longer than paper records
  * average of 20s per SNOMED code
* Use of Templates
  * speeds things up, but
  * generates excessive boilerplate
  * discourages being specific
    * easier to pick from a dropdown than to write out a phrase of detail
* HCP heuristics
  * contains *pertinent negatives* 
    * things that the patient doesn't have; but knowing they don't have them can help in Dx
  * very little noise in comparison to pre-populated data
  * they often copy+paste from previous notes
    * makes things worse though because it means errors are propagated across history + patients
    * studies have shown 58% of clinical text in a note has been previously copy+pasted
* current ideal is *semi-structured*
  * narrative text fields enriched by NLP + formally structured fields *of value*
#### 12.4.1.4 What to Do with Charts Older Than Your EHR
* an option is to load only 6-12 months of data from before going live with your EHR
* or do "relevant" or selectively pick data
* or do 1-2yrs of charts after installation and just slowly load them in over time
* OCR bruh, Optical Character Recognition
#### 12.4.1.5 Data Validation
* buzzwords: *validity checks, range, pattern, computed (sums/ratios make sense), consistency, delta (changes), and spelling checks*
### 12.4.2 Data Display
* For off-site view, TLS (Transport Layer Security) and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) are used
#### 12.4.2.1 Timeline Graphs
* ...lol the writer *loves* Tufte's sparklines
* tables are also cool
#### 12.4.2.2 Timeline Flowsheets
* basically specialized dashboards towards certain templates, ie. radiology
#### 12.4.2.3 Summaries and Snapshots
* Right now, the summaries are pretty low tech
* but we're looking at having CDS-empowered alertson these summaries
  * adverse events automatically pop up
#### 12.4.2.4 Dynamic Search
* Up to 84% of the time, physicians can't find the data they need on paper
* Different ways to search: visually through graphs, or auto-complete, or NLP, etc.
#### 12.4.3 Query and Surveillance Systems
* aka, yah. being able to dynamically search that stuff
  * except probably in the context of pop health or data scientists
    * outputs CDS
#### 12.4.3.1 Clinical Care
* Queries can be run to find patients who are late to stuff
* and audits, imig
#### 12.4.3.2 Clinical Research
* Query for patients eligible for clinical trials or research
#### 12.4.3.3 Quality Reporting
* ok but what's a quality report? quality of what, care?
* KPIs: functional status, pain scores, symptom reports, etc.
#### 12.4.3.4 Retrospective Studies
* the opposite, **prospective studies** are the gold standard
* but sometimes you can't, so **retrospective studies** are sufficient
* perks - fraction of time and cost
#### 12.4.3.5 Administration
* claims data is unreliable for understanding *clinical practice*
* cons - clinicians might start optimizing their docs to optimize payment and resource allocation
## 12.5 Challenges Ahead
* Two-way communication with PHRs
  * issue: no one has the time to go through and validate all the PHR data coming from *each* patient
### 12.5.1 Users' Information Needs
* how do you balance the needs of the administration (decisionmakers) and the providers (the actual users)
### 12.5.2 Usability
* metric to improve on: response time and minimization of data input fields
  * make sure that the fields prompted for are *actually* needed
* how do we integrate and combine different modalities of input for best UX
  * speech, typed, mouse, touch, images, etc.
### 12.5.3 Standards
* Y'all got a lot of rules, but there really need to be *better* rules
### 12.5.4 Privacy and Security
* HIPAA
### 12.5.5 Cost and Benefits
* old studies said that EHRs are better than paper
  * but newer ones don't find an association between EHRs+CDS and quality
### 12.5.6 Leadership
* There's something :shrug:
