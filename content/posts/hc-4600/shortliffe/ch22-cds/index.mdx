## Objectives
- [ ] Key motivations for CDS?
- [ ] How is CDS relevant to meaningful of EHRs?
- [ ] What are typical design consideraitions when building CDS?
- [ ] What are some ways in which devs of CDSS encode clinical knowledge?
- [ ] What are some current standards in HIT industry that facilitate the construction of CDSS
- [ ] Why has adoption been slow and what are the prospects of broader use?
- [ ] What are the key areas for R&D in CDSS?
## 22.0 - Introduction
* **Clinical Decision Support (CDS)** - process that "provides clinicians, staff, patients or other individuals with knowledge and person-specific; _intelligently_ filtered or person-specific information"
  * Aren't just fetching data; they also communicate
* Five right things
  * the right information
  * to the right person
  * in the right format
  * through the right channel
  * at the right point in the workflow
* Three basic varieties
  * Fetching relevant data based on the patient's info
    * "See Alsos"
    * In EHR world, have been called "infobuttons" in the past
  * Recommend based on patient-/situation-specific data
    * Recommendation systems
  * Organize and present data in a way that facilitates problem solving and decision making
    * ie. Dashboards
    * or documentation templates, structured reports, and order sets
      * Order sets - a collection of potential orders (Rx, Tx, etc.)
## 22.1 The Nature of Clinical Decision-Making
* Diagnosing isn't the only thing that CDS should tackle
  * Just as important is the *process* of diagnoses - what tests, procedures to order and how to analyze the values of such
    * A patient's response to an therapy/Tx is also a diagnostic test
  * An estimation of a prognosis can also provide value; as long as its ethically and reasonably conveyed as such
* CDS can also be used for population-level support
  * lab scientists can plan research based on CDS-driven data
  * hospital admins can use it for operational/resource management
* Strong CDS depends on 3 things:
  * Accurate data
  * Pertinent knowledge
  * Appropriate problem-solving skills
* Don't bombard your user with data!!!!
* data should be summarized for easier cognitive management
  * but don't over-simplify
* Be aware of your biases when designing CDS
* Cost-benefits must be kept in mind
* Be as held to as high standards as an actual clinician diagnosing a patient
## 22.2 Motivation for Computer-based CDS
* Three origins of urgency:
  * increasing challenges with large amounts of data
  * pressure to adopt EHRs and practice meaningful use
  * desire to deliver personalize healthcare - using a patient's preferences/genome as the foundation for care
### 22.2.1 Physician Information Needs and Clinical Data Management
* Unanswered clinical questions are common in ambulatory settings
  * 81% of clinical encounters may be missing critical information
* Might attribute to 18% of clinical errors
### 22.2.2 EHR Adoption and Meaningful Use
* Meaningful use kinda cuts off/gets fuzzy on defining on how EHRs/health systems should work with CDS
### 22.2.3 Personalized Medicine
* **Reductionst Biomedical Model** - the Dx process of breaking down conditions into smaller parts, and running tests/Tx to figure out what to diagnose and how to treat
* **Biopsychosocial Model** - New age mentality that include psychological and social (basically determinants) as a part of diagnosis and treatment of a patient
  * much more holistic
* Clinicians will be overwhelmed with the amount of data and expectations to use it (created by genomics, social determinants, etc.)
### 22.2.4 Saving Potential with Health IT and CDS
* hard to measure ROI of CDS
  * CDS comes early in the process before an endpoint is reached; therefore the stats are hard to control for considering the amount of things that can happen between the two touchpoints
## 22.3 Methods of CDS
* May summarize data, use logic, visualize data differently, provide therapy advice, suggest diagnostic assistance, cost-benefit analysis, etc.
* Three Case Studies
### 22.3.1 Leeds Abdominal Pain System
* Late 1960s, U of Leeds
* Bayesian stats on thousands of patients to diagnose/bucket reason for abdominal pain
  * ie. appnedicitis, diverticulitis, perforated ulcer, cholecystitis, small-bowel obstruction, pancreatitis, and non-specific (other)
* To make the math easy, it assumed that findings were independent of one another, and that the lines between the possible conditions were strict
* Models were verified/labeled based on what the real diagnosis was during surgery
* done retrospectively in batch processes
* clinicians were 65-80% correct; model was 91.8% correct
### 22.3.2 MYCIN
* rule-based consultation system for managing patients with blood-borne bacterial infections
* basically a choose-your-own-adventure flow chart
* If this and this and this, then that
* used backwards chaining
  * looked at previous answers in the chain to filter out the next level
    * If it knew you answered A on question 3 and C on question 5, then it knows to ask you about B on question 9
  * opposite is forward chaining - looking at the "also trues" in the logic tree ahead of it
  * **wow this is probably just all wrong**
    * trust [this instead](https://www.javatpoint.com/difference-between-backward-chaining-and-forward-chaining)
* Regardless, the charts were incredible volatile basically on singular node chang  es in the graph
### 22.3.3 HELP
* generated automated alerts when abnormalities in the patient record were discovered
* **ECA (Event-Condition-Action) Rule** - on an event, a condition is evaluated, and if true, an action is performed
### 22.3.4 Comparing the Early CDS Systems
* When developing, they all answered 3 questions
  * What input data will drive the decision
  * How will with output be communicated
  * How do you construct an output from the input
* Data collection
  * Leeds - checklists, not burdensome
  * MYCIN had a potentially long questionnaire 
  * HELP - no additional collection needed; already done passively through entering in the EHR
