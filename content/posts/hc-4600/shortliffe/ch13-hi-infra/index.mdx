## Objectives
* What is the vision and purpose of HII?
* What kinds of impacts will HII have, and in what time periods?
* What are the political and technical barriers to HII?
* What are the desirable traits of an HII?
## 13.1 Introduction
* **HII (Health Information Infrastructure)** - community level informatics systems designed to make complete patient records available for everyone
* Issues: privacy, stakeholder coop, digitalization of records, financial upkeep
* no country has a full HII
  * Canada, Australia, UK and some EU nations have spent billions on this
    * Should've been easy for these countries tho, bc centralized healthcare ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
## 13.2 Vision and Benefits of HII
* CDS using population-level data
* everyone would have access to this
  * clinicians wouldn't have to focus as much on info upkeep
  * patients could look back at their clinical notes and update info on it
    * or alert family members of emergency care, etc.
* Data can't be missing or else it's worthless for clinical insight
  * or worse: may provide misleading insight
* This chapter has a lot of repitition about the value and impact of CDS üò¨
* retrospective clinical studies would get a huge boost with the amount of *de-identified aggregate data*
* !!! Population-level surveillance on potential outbreaks of disease
  * If you have multiple hospitals/practices have a boost in a new virus, there's probably an epidemic going on
* > "Healthcare must be 'informed' before it can be 'reformed'."
## 13.3 History
* There were many **CHINS (Community Health Information Networks)** in the 90s
  * not enough value/urgency
* The ONC Executive Order also brought in **RHIOs (Regional Health Information Organizations)**
  * an attempt, but were not financially sustainable
## 13.4 Requirements for HII
* hard bc many stakeholders with varying priorities
### 13.4.1 Privacy and Trust
* failure to be secure means patients are less likely to share data
* HIPAA requires patient consent for record release
  * except for **TPO** cases - treatment, payments and operational purposes
  * TPO disclosures were not reported/tracked until recently (past decade or so)
* 13-17% of consumers (patients) intentionally hide data
  * doing lab tests under a psuedonym, or doing them out of state
### 13.4.2 Stakeholder Cooperation
* Mandating coop seems like the only way, but good luck doing that
### 13.4.3 Ensuring Information in Electronic Form
* You'd need end-to-end EHR adoption of all HCPs that a patient interacts with
* Cost/benefit of using EHRs isn't entirely there for places with limited resources
* In a study, 89% of an EHR's benefits were beneficial to someone besides the clinician üòí
* HITECH subsidies for EHR adoption - $44k to $64k
  * subsidies are one time, EHR subscriptions are forever
* Hospitals can afford to adopt EHRs since they get **DRG (Diagnosis-Related Group)** reimbursement incentives
  * fixed amounts per reported with specific condition
  * [Read more about it here](https://www.ahd.com/ip_ipps08.html)
### 13.4.4 Financial Sustainability
* Three approaches for FS
  1. public subsidy
    * supporters believe an HII is a public good, such as roads
    * taxes - integrate paying for an HII via adding taxes 
    * or user fees
  2. leveraging future cost savings
    * its a hard-to-predict, nebulous amount for most hospital systems
  3. leverage new value adds
    * or potential reductions
      * ex. removing the need for lab test deliveries
* Most lucrative is building CDS apps not available without all this data
### 13.4.5 Community Focus
* trust is typically founded at the local level
* lack of HIIs larger than 10m because trust dissipates
### 13.4.6 Governance and Organizational Issues
* the governing org must be trusted
  * and devoid of any biases
* many argue that an HII can't be run by the gov because you can't trust the gov
* can't put at the employer-level because people don't want health records associated with their employers
* can't put it at the insurer levels because insurers want to deny/not reimburse care
* hospitals are in competition with each other, so you can't trust it to hospitals
* physicians are trusted, but they're not organized
* maybe a new third party is needed
## 13.5 Architecture of HII
### 13.5.1 Institution-centric Architecture
* most existing HII systems sit at the institution/health system level
* expensive to query
  * you'd have to sequential search for a specific stat üôÉ
  * you could pre-index, but then you're just duplicating your data over at an exponential scale
* breaking down the queries at the provider-level and then rolling up isn't effective
  * no single provider has the entire longituding record for a patient
  * PCORNet and their data marts aren't necessarily this, but think that level of distribution
* **NOC (Network Operations Center)** - basically SRO, but for an entire system, 24/7 uptime
### 13.5.2 Patient-Centric Architecture (Health Record Banking)
* **HRB (Health Record Bank)** - an independent organization that manages patient data, like a bank but for clinical records
* Patient gives HCP access to their own health records, and the HCP uses that access key to query the HRB
#### 13.5.2.1 Patient Control Ensures Privacy and Stakeholder Cooperation
* In an HRB, everything requires the *consumer's consent* inherently
* Okay, so like patients can now trust orgs, but can physicians trust *patients*?
  * we'd need transparency and a constantnly updated/write-locked PHR/HRB
#### 13.5.2.2 Assuring the Information is in Electronic Form and Complies with Standards
* In order to interface with an HRB, clinicians must be on an EHR, ofc
  * can't trust a printed out HRB üìÅ
* we're still struggling with outpatient EHR adoption though
* create incentives for a physician to upload to an HRB
* If the EHR is run by the HRB, then you don't need to worry about interop*
#### 13.5.2.3 Business Model
* lower cost and higher revenue opportunities than putting the patient data into an institution
* Institution-centric HII's have an average of 2.73 failures per day
* Easier to query since you have N nodes for N data points (a patient record)
  * great for alert-based CDS systems!
    * either a node directly gives the message to the patient, or sends it outbound to a physician's EHR
  * also great for advertising directly to patients
    * not just drugs, I hope
    * but also health initiatives, better habits, preventive care, etc.
    * by god though, what a fine line between being a health history-driven Google or FB....
* A lot of these business models are made at the patient-level
  * "$4 per patient per year, $20 per patient per year for 20% of patients"
* Possible ways that HRBs could keep EHRs in check by subsidizing
  * promotes more EHR adoption
  * subsidize only compliant EHRs (ex. following data interop standards)
## 13.6 HII Evaluation
* Measures
  * The KPIs for evaluation an HII must change over time, as technology changes pretty quickly (like every 5-8 years)
  * Metrics must be affective to most stakeholders
  * measures must be valuable to policymakers or else no movement will happen
  * the eval methods should be quick and easy, so you don't focus on always being audited/measured
* Examples of metrics
  * % of pop in an HII
  * % of HCPs using an HII
  * Variety/spread of clinical settings: inpatient, outpatient, long-term, home care, community, etc.
  * usage: forms, CPOEs, Rx, etc.
* Currently, most of the largest HIIs are only 60-78% satisfactory
## 13.7 Conclusion
* We gotta make progress, folks.
